# A Comprehensive Guide to GitLab Omnibus Components: Architecture, Interconnections, and Administration

## 1. Introduction

GitLab Omnibus is a comprehensive software package designed to simplify the installation, configuration, and maintenance of a self-managed GitLab instance.1 It bundles all necessary components, including the GitLab application itself, web servers, database systems, and various supporting services, into a single, cohesive package. This approach streamlines deployment and ensures that all bundled components are version-compatible and pre-configured to work together effectively.1

This report provides an in-depth analysis of key components within the GitLab Omnibus package: Nginx, Grafana (with a note on its deprecation), Prometheus, GitLab-workhorse, GitLab-rails, Redis, Sidekiq, Puma, Praefect, and Gitaly. The objective is to elucidate the role of each component, detail its interactions with other services, provide illustrative configuration examples from the central `gitlab.rb` file, outline common administrative commands using `gitlab-ctl`, and discuss their log locations. Furthermore, this guide will explore the interconnections between these components to offer a holistic understanding of the GitLab Omnibus architecture, culminating in a conceptual mind map and best practices for monitoring and troubleshooting.

## 2. Understanding GitLab Omnibus

### 2.1. The Omnibus Philosophy: Simplicity and Consistency

The core principle behind GitLab Omnibus is to provide a "fat package" â€“ a single binary distribution that contains all required dependencies for running GitLab.1 This contrasts with traditional software deployment where individual components might need to be installed and configured separately. The primary goal is to make GitLab installation and upgrades straightforward, even for users with minimal system administration knowledge.1

This philosophy offers significant benefits:

- **For Users:** Installation effort is minimized, basic configuration is simplified, upgrades between versions are easier, and users are encouraged to stay on the latest, most feature-rich versions.1
- **For GitLab Maintainers:** It allows for the distribution of a single binary package, simultaneous shipping for multiple platforms, assurance that all necessary and compatible component versions are included, and easier support due to more consistent user environments.1

While this approach means the package makes many decisions for the user (like directory structures and port usage), it provides extensive configuration options to adapt to various environments.1 The Omnibus package includes its own UNIX init supervision system, `runit`, to manage the lifecycle of the bundled services.1

### 2.2. Core Architecture & Management in Omnibus

Omnibus GitLab establishes a specific and managed environment on the host system.

- **File Ownership and Permissions:** By default, files within the GitLab Rails application tree (e.g., `app/`, `config/`) are owned by `root`. This design choice simplifies installation and enhances security. The `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` script, which applies configurations from `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`, grants write access to the `git` user (the primary user under which GitLab application logic runs) only where strictly necessary, such as log directories, upload paths, and the database schema file (`db/structure.sql`).3
    
- **Directory Structure:** A key design aspect is the separation of code, data, and logs 3:
    
    - **Code:** Resides under `/opt/gitlab` and is treated as read-only.
    - **Data:** Stored under `/var/opt/gitlab` and is read/write. This includes Git repositories, uploads, and configuration files that GitLab modifies.
    - **Logs:** Located under `/var/log/gitlab` and are read/write.
- **Symlinks for Path Management:** To enforce this directory structure, the reconfigure script customizes paths in GitLab configuration files. Where direct path configuration is not possible, symlinks are employed. For instance, `config/gitlab.yml` within the Rails application directory is often a symlink to a file in `/var/opt/gitlab`, treating it as mutable data. Similarly, the `log/` directory within the Rails application is typically a symlink to `/var/log/gitlab/gitlab-rails`.3 This structured approach facilitates backups, upgrades, and understanding the system's layout.
    
- **Service Management with `runit`:** Omnibus GitLab uses `runit` as its init and service supervision system.1 Each bundled service (e.g., Nginx, Puma, Gitaly) is managed by `runit`. When a new service is added to Omnibus, it involves 2:
    
    1. Defining the software and its compilation during the package build.
    2. Adding configuration objects in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`.
    3. Creating Chef recipes to enable and disable the service. These recipes typically create necessary users, directories, and then define the `runit` service.
    4. A `runit` service definition usually involves a `run` script (to start the service) and a `log/run` script (to manage its logging via `svlogd`).
    5. Log rotation for `runit`-managed services is handled by `svlogd`, which writes to a `current` file and periodically compresses and renames old logs.4 Non-`runit` logs are typically managed by `logrotate`.4

The `gitlab-ctl` command-line utility serves as the primary interface for administrators to interact with these `runit`-managed services, providing commands to start, stop, restart, and check the status of GitLab and its components.5

## 3. Deep Dive into Key Components

This section explores the individual roles, interactions, configuration, and administration of the core components within GitLab Omnibus.

### 3.1. Nginx: The Web Server and Reverse Proxy

- Role & Responsibilities:
    
    Nginx is an open-source, high-performance web server and reverse proxy. In GitLab Omnibus, it serves as the primary entry point for all HTTP and HTTPS traffic.7 Its key responsibilities include:
    
    - **Request Routing:** Directing incoming web requests to the appropriate backend component, primarily GitLab-workhorse.8
    - **SSL/TLS Termination:** Handling HTTPS connections, decrypting incoming traffic, and encrypting outgoing traffic. This offloads SSL processing from the application servers.7
    - **Serving Static Assets:** Efficiently delivering static content like CSS, JavaScript, and images directly, reducing the load on GitLab-workhorse and Puma.8
    - **Load Balancing (in multi-node setups):** While not its primary role in a single-node Omnibus, Nginx can be part of a load-balancing strategy in larger deployments.
    - **Implementing HTTP Headers:** Setting various HTTP headers crucial for security and application functionality.
- **Key Interactions:**
    
    - **Clients (User Browsers, Git Clients):** Receives all HTTP/S requests from clients.
    - **GitLab-workhorse:** Forwards most dynamic requests and Git-over-HTTP/S requests to GitLab-workhorse, typically via a Unix socket for efficiency.8
    - **Let's Encrypt (optional):** Interacts with Let's Encrypt for automatic SSL certificate issuance and renewal if configured.7
    - **Other Bundled Services (e.g., Mattermost, Registry - if enabled and configured to use bundled Nginx):** Can route traffic to other services that might be bundled with GitLab.8
    
    The typical flow is Client -> Nginx -> GitLab-workhorse. Nginx handles the initial connection, SSL, and serves static files. If the request is dynamic or for a Git operation, it's passed to Workhorse.
    
- Core gitlab.rb Configuration Snippets:
    
    Nginx is configured via the /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb file. Key settings include 8:
    
    - Enabling/Disabling Nginx (enabled by default):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        nginx['enable'] = true
        ```
        
    - Setting listen ports and enabling HTTPS:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
        nginx['listen_port'] = 80
        nginx['listen_https'] = false # Set to true for HTTPS
        # external_url 'https://gitlab.example.com' # This will also configure Nginx for SSL
        
        # If using custom SSL certificates:
        # nginx['ssl_certificate'] = "/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.example.com.crt"
        # nginx['ssl_certificate_key'] = "/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.example.com.key"
        # nginx['redirect_http_to_https'] = true
        
        # For custom Nginx settings
        # nginx['custom_gitlab_server_config'] = "location /custom_path {... }"
        ```
        
    
    This `external_url` setting is fundamental as it informs Nginx and other components about the public-facing URL of the GitLab instance. If HTTPS is used in `external_url`, Omnibus will attempt to configure Nginx for SSL, potentially using Let's Encrypt if enabled, or requiring manual certificate paths. The `nginx['custom_gitlab_server_config']` directive is particularly powerful, allowing administrators to inject custom Nginx location blocks or other server configurations directly into the main GitLab server block without needing to edit the Nginx configuration files managed by Omnibus. This preserves the ability to receive updates to the core Nginx configuration while still allowing for specific customizations.
    
- Administration & Usage:
    
    The gitlab-ctl utility is used for managing the Nginx service 5:
    
    - Restarting Nginx: `sudo gitlab-ctl restart nginx`.
    - Reloading Nginx configuration (graceful reload, attempts to apply changes without dropping connections): `sudo gitlab-ctl hup nginx`.
    - Checking Nginx status: `sudo gitlab-ctl status nginx`.
    - Applying configuration changes from `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`: `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.
    - Log location: Nginx logs, including access and error logs, are typically found in `/var/log/gitlab/nginx/` (e.g., `gitlab_access.log`, `gitlab_error.log`).4
- **Table: Key `nginx[...]` settings in `gitlab.rb`**
    

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Setting**|**Description**|**Example Value**|
|`enable`|Enables or disables the bundled Nginx service.|`true`|
|`listen_port`|The HTTP port Nginx listens on if HTTPS is not enabled or `external_url` specifies HTTP.|`80`|
|`listen_https`|Whether Nginx should listen on the HTTPS port (usually 443). Defaults based on `external_url`.|`true`|
|`listen_addresses`|Array of IP addresses Nginx should listen on.|`['*', '::']` (listen on all IPv4 and IPv6)|
|`ssl_certificate`|Path to the SSL certificate file (PEM format).|`"/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.example.com.crt"`|
|`ssl_certificate_key`|Path to the SSL private key file (PEM format).|`"/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.example.com.key"`|
|`redirect_http_to_https`|If true, redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.|`true`|
|`real_ip_trusted_addresses`|Array of IP addresses or CIDR blocks of trusted reverse proxies (e.g., load balancers).|`['192.168.1.0/24', '10.0.0.5']`|
|`custom_gitlab_server_config`|A string containing custom Nginx configuration to be inserted into the GitLab `server` block.|`"add_header X-Custom-Header ' wartoÅ›Ä‡';"`|
|`custom_nginx_config`|A string containing custom Nginx configuration to be inserted into the main `http` block.|`"include /etc/nginx/conf.d/custom_proxy.conf;"`|
|`proxy_set_headers`|A hash of additional headers to set for proxied requests to GitLab Workhorse.|`{ 'X-Forwarded-User' => '$remote_user' }`|
|`letsencrypt['enable']`|Enables automatic SSL certificate management using Let's Encrypt.|`true`|

```
The role of Nginx extends beyond merely serving web pages; it acts as a critical gatekeeper, security layer (SSL termination, IP filtering via trusted proxies), and performance enhancer (static content serving) for the entire GitLab instance. Its configuration flexibility through `gitlab.rb`, especially with custom directives, allows for adaptation to complex network environments without compromising the manageability of the Omnibus package.
```

### 3.2. GitLab-workhorse: The Smart Reverse Proxy

- Role & Responsibilities:
    
    GitLab-workhorse is a lightweight, Go-based reverse proxy that sits between Nginx and the GitLab Rails application (Puma).7 Its primary purpose is to handle slow, long-running, or large HTTP requests, thereby offloading these tasks from the resource-intensive Puma workers and improving the overall responsiveness and stability of GitLab.12
    
    Key responsibilities include 12:
    
    - **Handling Git operations over HTTP/S:** Manages `git clone`, `git pull`, and `git push` requests. After the Rails application performs authentication and authorization, Workhorse takes over the data transfer directly with Gitaly.
    - **File Uploads and Downloads:** Processes large file transfers, such as CI/CD artifacts, LFS objects, and package repository assets. It can stream these directly to/from object storage or temporary files, bypassing Rails for the bulk data transfer.
    - **CI Runner Long Polling:** Efficiently manages long-lived HTTP connections from GitLab Runners checking for new jobs, reducing the load on Puma.
    - **Websocket Proxying:** Handles WebSocket connections for features like the web terminal and interactive Web IDE sessions.
    - **Request/Response Modification:** Workhorse can modify HTTP requests before they reach Rails (e.g., for LFS uploads, it saves the file and passes a path to Rails) and modify responses from Rails (e.g., handling `send_file` directives by streaming the file content itself).
    - **Serving some static assets:** While Nginx is the primary server for static assets, Workhorse can also serve some if configured or if Nginx passes the request through.
    
    Workhorse does not connect to the PostgreSQL database directly but communicates extensively with GitLab Rails (Puma) for authorization and instructions, and can optionally use Redis for certain features like CI long polling.12
    
- **Key Interactions:**
    
    - **Nginx:** Receives proxied requests from Nginx.13
    - **Puma/GitLab-rails:** Forwards requests to Puma for application logic, authentication, and authorization. It "hijacks" responses from Rails when instructed (e.g., via special `X-Sendfile-Type` headers or specific content types) to handle data-intensive parts of the request lifecycle.12
    - **Gitaly:** After authorization from Rails, Workhorse communicates directly with Gitaly via gRPC for Git operations.13
    - **Redis:** May connect to Redis for features like CI runner long polling, using Redis Pub/Sub capabilities.12
    - **Object Storage:** Can directly handle uploads to and downloads from object storage for artifacts, LFS objects, etc., based on pre-signed URLs or instructions from Rails.13
- Core gitlab.rb Configuration Snippets:
    
    Configuring GitLab-workhorse via gitlab.rb often involves setting environment variables or specific keys. Direct gitlab_workhorse[...] keys are less numerous compared to other components, as many settings are derived or managed internally.8
    
    - Enabling Workhorse (typically enabled by default and linked to `gitlab_rails['enable']`):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```groovy
        gitlab_workhorse['enable'] = true
        ```
        
    - Listen address and network (default is a Unix socket, TCP can be configured if Nginx is on a different host or for specific needs) 8:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```groovy
        # Default Unix socket configuration (managed by Omnibus)
        # gitlab_workhorse['listen_network'] = "unix"
        # gitlab_workhorse['listen_addr'] = "/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse/socket"
        
        # Example TCP configuration
        # gitlab_workhorse['listen_network'] = "tcp"
        # gitlab_workhorse['listen_addr'] = "127.0.0.1:8181"
        ```
        
    - Authentication backend (points to the Puma/Rails socket or TCP address):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```groovy
        gitlab_workhorse['auth_backend'] = "unix:/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/sockets/gitlab.socket"
        # Or for TCP:
        # gitlab_workhorse['auth_backend'] = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
        ```
        
    - Prometheus metrics listener 17:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```groovy
        gitlab_workhorse['prometheus_listen_addr'] = "localhost:9229"
        ```
        
    - Sentry DSN for error tracking (via environment variables) 15:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```groovy
        gitlab_workhorse['env'] = {
          'GITLAB_WORKHORSE_SENTRY_DSN' => 'https://your_sentry_dsn_here',
          'GITLAB_WORKHORSE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT' => 'production'
        }
        ```
        
    - Trusted CIDRs for correlation ID propagation 15:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```groovy
        gitlab_workhorse['trusted_cidrs_for_propagation'] = ["127.0.0.1/32", "::1/128"]
        ```
        
    - Example configuration:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```groovy
        # /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
        gitlab_workhorse['enable'] = true
        # Workhorse typically listens on a Unix socket by default, path derived from gitlab_rails settings
        # To explicitly set, though often not needed:
        # gitlab_workhorse['listen_network'] = "unix"
        # gitlab_workhorse['listen_addr'] = "/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse/socket"
        gitlab_workhorse['auth_backend'] = "unix:/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/sockets/gitlab.socket" # Path to Puma socket
        
        gitlab_workhorse['prometheus_listen_addr'] = "localhost:9229"
        
        # For Sentry error tracking
        # gitlab_workhorse['env'] = {
        #   'GITLAB_WORKHORSE_SENTRY_DSN' => 'https://your_sentry_dsn_here',
        #   'GITLAB_WORKHORSE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT' => 'production'
        # }
        ```
        
    
    The relative scarcity of direct `gitlab_workhorse[...]` keys in the `gitlab.rb.template` 16 suggests that many of its operational parameters are either intelligently defaulted based on other settings (like the Rails socket path) or configured via the more generic `gitlab_workhorse['env']` for passing environment variables. This design simplifies common setups while still allowing advanced configuration where needed.
    
- Administration & Usage:
    
    Management is done via gitlab-ctl 5:
    
    - Restarting Workhorse: `sudo gitlab-ctl restart gitlab-workhorse`.
    - Checking status: `sudo gitlab-ctl status gitlab-workhorse`.
    - Applying configuration changes: `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.
    - Log location: `/var/log/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse/`.6 Logs often contain `senddata` entries when Workhorse "hijacks" a response from Rails to stream data.
- **Table: Key `gitlab_workhorse[...]` settings in `gitlab.rb`**
    

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Setting**|**Description**|**Example Value**|
|`enable`|Enables or disables the GitLab-workhorse service.|`true`|
|`listen_network`|Network type for listening (e.g., "unix", "tcp").|`"unix"`|
|`listen_addr`|Address or path for listening (e.g., socket path or IP:port).|`"/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse/socket"` or `"127.0.0.1:8181"`|
|`auth_backend`|URL of the GitLab Rails application (Puma) for authorization checks.|`"unix:/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/sockets/gitlab.socket"`|
|`prometheus_listen_addr`|Address and port for the Prometheus metrics endpoint.|`"localhost:9229"`|
|`env`|Hash of environment variables to set for Workhorse (e.g., for Sentry DSN).|`{ 'GITLAB_WORKHORSE_SENTRY_DSN': '...' }`|
|`trusted_cidrs_for_propagation`|Array of CIDR blocks trusted for propagating correlation IDs.|`["127.0.0.1/32", "::1/128"]`|
|`api_limit`|Number of concurrent API requests allowed.|`0` (disabled by default in Omnibus)|
|`api_ci_long_polling_duration`|Duration for CI long polling requests.|`"50s"`|

```
The strategic placement and functionality of GitLab-workhorse are pivotal for GitLab's performance, particularly under heavy load involving large data transfers or numerous long-polling connections. Its ability to "hijack" requests based on directives from the Rails backend is a sophisticated mechanism that allows the main application to delegate resource-intensive I/O without losing control over authorization and business logic. This significantly reduces the memory footprint and CPU load on the Ruby application servers.
```

### 3.3. Puma (and GitLab-rails): The Application Core

- **Role & Responsibilities:**
    
    - **Puma:** Puma is a fast, multi-threaded Ruby HTTP server. Within GitLab Omnibus, it is responsible for running the main GitLab Rails application.7 It replaced Unicorn as the default application server primarily due to its superior memory efficiency and concurrency model, which leverages threads within worker processes.18
    - **GitLab-rails:** This is the heart of GitLab â€“ the Ruby on Rails application that provides all of GitLab's features, including the web interface, API, user management, project management, issue tracking, merge requests, CI/CD logic, and more.7 It handles all business logic, authentication, authorization, and orchestrates interactions with other backend services like PostgreSQL, Redis, and Gitaly.
- **Key Interactions:**
    
    - **GitLab-workhorse:** Puma receives processed HTTP requests from GitLab-workhorse, typically via a Unix domain socket for performance and security.18 Workhorse handles initial request filtering and offloads certain tasks, but Puma/Rails executes the core application logic.
    - **PostgreSQL:** GitLab-rails uses PostgreSQL as its primary relational database for storing persistent data such as user accounts, project information, issues, merge requests, CI/CD pipeline metadata, permissions, and much more.7
    - **Redis:** GitLab-rails interacts extensively with Redis for various purposes: application caching (to speed up responses and reduce database load), user session storage, and as a message broker for enqueuing background jobs to be processed by Sidekiq.7
    - **Gitaly:** For any operation involving Git repository data (e.g., reading files, browsing commits, processing pushes/pulls), GitLab-rails makes gRPC calls to Gitaly servers (or Praefect in a Gitaly Cluster setup).7
    - **Sidekiq:** The Rails application defines and enqueues background jobs (e.g., sending notification emails, running repository maintenance tasks, processing webhooks) into Redis. These jobs are then picked up and executed by Sidekiq worker processes.7
- Core gitlab.rb Configuration Snippets:
    
    Configuration for Puma and GitLab-rails is extensive and managed via /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb.16
    
    - **Puma settings:**
        
        - `puma['enable'] = true` (enabled by default).
        - `puma['worker_processes']`: Defines the number of Puma worker processes. Omnibus typically calculates a default based on available CPU cores, but it can be manually set. For example, `puma['worker_processes'] = 4`.18
        - `puma['min_threads']` and `puma['max_threads']`: Control the number of threads each Puma worker process can use to handle requests concurrently. For example, `puma['min_threads'] = 4`, `puma['max_threads'] = 4`.18
        - `puma['socket'] = '/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/sockets/gitlab.socket'`: Specifies the path to the Unix socket Puma listens on for connections from Workhorse.18
        - `puma['listen']` and `puma['port']`: Can be used if TCP listening is required, though Unix sockets are more common for local inter-process communication with Workhorse.
        - `puma['worker_timeout'] = 60`: Sets the timeout in seconds for a worker to process a request.18
        - `puma['per_worker_max_memory_mb'] = 1200`: A crucial setting that defines the maximum memory (RSS) a Puma worker can consume before it's automatically restarted by a supervisor thread. This helps prevent memory leaks from impacting the entire instance.18
        - `puma['exporter_enabled'] = true`, `puma['exporter_port'] = 8083`, `puma['exporter_address'] = 'localhost'`: Configuration for the Prometheus metrics exporter embedded in Puma.17
    - **GitLab-rails settings (`gitlab_rails['...']`):** This is the most extensive set of configurations, controlling virtually every aspect of GitLab's functionality.
        
        - `external_url 'http://gitlab.example.com'`: A top-level setting, but critically important for Rails to generate correct URLs, redirects, and for many integrations to function correctly.9
        - Database connection: `gitlab_rails['db_adapter']`, `gitlab_rails['db_host']`, `gitlab_rails['db_port']`, `gitlab_rails['db_username']`, `gitlab_rails['db_password']`, `gitlab_rails['db_database']`.16
        - Redis connection (for caching, sessions, Sidekiq queues): `gitlab_rails['redis_host']`, `gitlab_rails['redis_port']`, `gitlab_rails['redis_password']`, `gitlab_rails['redis_socket']`, and specific instances like `gitlab_rails['redis_cache_instance']`, `gitlab_rails['redis_queues_instance']`.16
        - Gitaly connection: `gitlab_rails['gitaly_token']` (if Gitaly uses auth), `gitlab_rails['repositories_storages']` (maps storage names to Gitaly server addresses).16
        - SMTP settings for email notifications: `gitlab_rails['smtp_enable'] = true`, `gitlab_rails['smtp_address']`, `gitlab_rails['smtp_port']`, etc..16
        - LDAP integration: `gitlab_rails['ldap_enabled'] = true`, `gitlab_rails['ldap_servers'] = { 'main' => {... } }`.16
        - Logging: `gitlab_rails['log_level']` (e.g., `'info'`, `'debug'`), `gitlab_rails['production_log_json'] = true` (to enable JSON formatted logs).
        - Numerous feature flags and specific behavioral settings (e.g., `gitlab_rails['gravatar_enabled'] = false`, `gitlab_rails['webhook_timeout'] = 10`).
    - Example configuration:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
        external_url 'https://gitlab.example.com' # Crucial for Rails functionality
        
        puma['worker_processes'] = 3 # Example: 3 worker processes
        puma['min_threads'] = 4
        puma['max_threads'] = 8
        puma['per_worker_max_memory_mb'] = 1024 # Set max memory to 1GB per worker
        
        gitlab_rails['time_zone'] = 'America/New_York'
        gitlab_rails['gitlab_email_from'] = 'noreply@gitlab.example.com'
        gitlab_rails['gitlab_default_theme'] = 2 # Dark theme as default
        
        # Example for connecting to an external PostgreSQL database
        # postgresql['enable'] = false # Disable bundled PostgreSQL
        # gitlab_rails['db_adapter'] = "postgresql"
        # gitlab_rails['db_encoding'] = "unicode"
        # gitlab_rails['db_database'] = "gitlabhq_production"
        # gitlab_rails['db_host'] = "db.example.com"
        # gitlab_rails['db_port'] = 5432
        # gitlab_rails['db_username'] = "gitlab_user"
        # gitlab_rails['db_password'] = "secure_password"
        
        # Example for connecting to an external Redis server
        # redis['enable'] = false # Disable bundled Redis
        # gitlab_rails['redis_host'] = "redis.example.com"
        # gitlab_rails['redis_port'] = 6379
        # gitlab_rails['redis_password'] = "redis_secure_password"
        ```
        
    
    The switch from Unicorn to Puma was a strategic decision to enhance resource utilization. Puma's multi-threaded model allows a single worker process to handle multiple concurrent requests, especially beneficial for I/O-bound operations common in web applications. This generally leads to lower memory consumption per request compared to Unicorn's multi-process model.18 The `puma['per_worker_max_memory_mb']` setting is a vital operational control, acting as a safety net against potential memory leaks in individual worker processes by restarting them if they exceed the defined threshold, thus maintaining overall system stability. The sheer breadth of `gitlab_rails['...']` settings highlights its position as the central nervous system of the GitLab application, where nearly all functional aspects can be tuned.
    
- Administration & Usage:
    
    Management of Puma and access to Rails utilities are primarily through gitlab-ctl 5:
    
    - Restarting Puma: `sudo gitlab-ctl restart puma`.
    - Graceful reload of Puma (reloads application code, useful for some changes without a full restart): `sudo gitlab-ctl hup puma`.5
    - Checking Puma status: `sudo gitlab-ctl status puma`.
    - Applying configuration changes: `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.
    - Log locations: Puma server logs are in `/var/log/gitlab/puma/`. GitLab Rails application logs (e.g., `production.log`, `api_json.log`, `application_json.log`, `integrations_json.log`) are in `/var/log/gitlab/gitlab-rails/`.6
    - Accessing the Rails console for debugging or advanced operations: `sudo gitlab-rails console`.
    - Running Rake tasks (database migrations, checks, etc.): `sudo gitlab-rake <task_name>` (e.g., `sudo gitlab-rake db:migrate`, `sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check`).

|`gitlab_rails['smtp_enable']`|GitLab Rails|Enables SMTP for sending emails.|`true`|
|`gitlab_rails['ldap_enabled']`|GitLab Rails|Enables LDAP integration for user authentication.|`true`|

```
The combination of Puma and GitLab-rails forms the application core, handling user interactions, business logic, and orchestrating the complex dance between various data stores and specialized services. Effective tuning of Puma workers and threads, along with careful configuration of database and Redis connections, is paramount for a performant and stable GitLab instance.
```

### 3.4. Redis: Caching, Sessions, and Job Queuing

- Role & Responsibilities:
    
    Redis is an in-memory data structure store, renowned for its speed and versatility. In GitLab Omnibus, it serves multiple critical functions 7:
    
    - **Caching:** Stores frequently accessed data (e.g., rendered HTML fragments, results of expensive queries) to reduce latency and database load. This is primarily managed via `Rails.cache`.23
    - **Session Storage:** Manages user session data, allowing users to stay logged in across requests and even application restarts.
    - **Sidekiq Job Queuing:** Acts as the message broker for Sidekiq. GitLab-rails enqueues background jobs (like email notifications, CI pipeline processing, webhooks) into Redis queues, which Sidekiq workers then consume.23
    - **CI Trace Chunks:** Stores intermediate chunks of CI job logs before they are archived.23
    - **ActionCable Backend:** Serves as the Pub/Sub backend for ActionCable, enabling real-time features in the GitLab UI.23
    - **Rate Limiting:** Stores state and counters for implementing rate limits on various actions to protect the instance from abuse.23
    - **Shared Application State:** Manages transient, shared state between different GitLab processes where using PostgreSQL might be too slow or inappropriate.23
    
    For larger deployments, GitLab supports configuring multiple distinct Redis instances (e.g., one for caching, one for queues, one for shared state) to better isolate workloads and improve scalability. High availability for Redis can be achieved using Redis Sentinel.23
    
- **Key Interactions:**
    
    - **GitLab-rails (Puma):** Reads from and writes to Redis for caching, session management, and enqueues background jobs for Sidekiq. It also uses Redis for rate limiting and ActionCable.23
    - **Sidekiq:** Connects to Redis to dequeue jobs from various queues for asynchronous processing. It also updates job status and metadata in Redis.23
    - **GitLab-workhorse:** Can utilize Redis for specific features, notably CI runner long polling, where it listens for job notifications via Redis Pub/Sub.12
    - **GitLab Shell:** May interact with Redis indirectly via GitLab-rails for features like rate limiting on Git operations.31
- Core gitlab.rb Configuration Snippets:
    
    Redis configuration in /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb covers both the bundled Redis server and how GitLab application components connect to it.16
    
    - Enabling/disabling the bundled Redis server (enabled by default):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        redis['enable'] = true
        ```
        
    - Configuring the bundled Redis server:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        redis['bind'] = '127.0.0.1'  # Default, listen only on localhost
        redis['port'] = 6379        # Default Redis port
        # redis['password'] = 'your-secure-redis-password' # If password protection is desired
        redis['socket'] = '/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.socket' # Default Unix socket path
        ```
        
    - Configuring GitLab Rails to connect to Redis (applies to bundled or external Redis):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        gitlab_rails['redis_host'] = '127.0.0.1'
        gitlab_rails['redis_port'] = 6379
        # gitlab_rails['redis_password'] = 'your-secure-redis-password'
        # gitlab_rails['redis_socket'] = '/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.socket' # For Unix socket connection
        gitlab_rails['redis_ssl'] = true # If connecting to Redis over SSL
        ```
        
    - Configuring separate Redis instances for different stores (e.g., cache, queues, shared_state). Each of these keys can point to a different Redis server URI or Sentinel setup:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # Example for using a separate Redis for queues
        # gitlab_rails['redis_queues_instance'] = "redis://queues-redis.example.com:6380"
        # gitlab_rails['redis_queues_password'] = "queues_password"
        # Or for Sentinel configuration for queues:
        # gitlab_rails['redis_queues_sentinels'] = [
        #   {'host' => 'redis-sentinel1.example.com', 'port' => 26379},
        #   {'host' => 'redis-sentinel2.example.com', 'port' => 26379}
        # ]
        # gitlab_rails['redis_queues_sentinel_master_name'] = 'gitlab-redis-queues'
        # gitlab_rails['redis_queues_sentinel_password'] = 'sentinel_auth_password'
        ```
        
        Similar configurations exist for `redis_cache_instance`, `redis_shared_state_instance`, `redis_trace_chunks_instance`, `redis_actioncable_instance`, `redis_rate_limiting_instance`, and `redis_sessions_instance`.16
    - Redis Sentinel configuration (for High Availability) 30:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # On Redis nodes participating in Sentinel
        # redis['master_name'] = 'gitlab-redis'
        # redis['master_password'] = 'redis-password-goes-here'
        # redis['announce_ip'] = 'this_node_ip'
        # redis['announce_port'] = this_node_port
        
        # sentinel['enable'] = true
        # sentinel['quorum'] = 2 # Example
        
        # On GitLab Rails nodes connecting to Sentinel-managed Redis
        # gitlab_rails['redis_sentinels'] = [
        #   {'host' => 'redis-sentinel1.example.com', 'port' => 26379},
        #   {'host' => 'redis-sentinel2.example.com', 'port' => 26379},
        #   {'host' => 'redis-sentinel3.example.com', 'port' => 26379}
        # ]
        # # For the primary Redis instance (often used for shared_state and cache by default if not split)
        # gitlab_rails['redis_host'] = 'gitlab-redis' # This should match redis['master_name']
        # gitlab_rails['redis_password'] = 'redis-password-goes-here'
        ```
        
    - Example for a single, bundled Redis instance:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
        # Bundled Redis server configuration
        redis['enable'] = true
        redis['bind'] = '127.0.0.1' # Listen only on localhost by default
        redis['port'] = 6379
        # redis['password'] = 'strongpassword'
        
        # GitLab Rails application's connection to this Redis
        gitlab_rails['redis_host'] = '127.0.0.1'
        gitlab_rails['redis_port'] = 6379
        # gitlab_rails['redis_password'] = 'strongpassword'
        # Alternatively, using the default Unix socket (often preferred for local connections):
        # gitlab_rails['redis_socket'] = '/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.socket'
        ```
        
    
    The multifaceted role of Redis in GitLab underscores its importance. Its performance and availability directly influence user experience (caching, sessions, real-time updates) and system throughput (background job processing). The architecture allowing for distinct Redis instances for different functionalities (cache, queues, shared state) provides a significant scaling vector for larger GitLab deployments, enabling administrators to allocate resources and manage availability independently for these varied workloads.23
    
- Administration & Usage:
    
    Redis service management and client access are handled as follows 6:
    
    - Restarting the bundled Redis service: `sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis`.
    - Checking Redis status: `sudo gitlab-ctl status redis`.
    - Applying configuration changes: `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.
    - Log location for bundled Redis: `/var/log/gitlab/redis/`.6
    - Connecting to Redis using `redis-cli` (the command-line interface):
        - Via Unix socket: `sudo /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -s /var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.socket`.24
        - Via TCP: `sudo /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379`.24
        - With password: `sudo /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 -a <password>`.24
- **Table: Key `redis[...]` and `gitlab_rails['redis_...]` settings in `gitlab.rb`**
    

|   |   |   |   |

```
The health and configuration of Redis are paramount. Issues with Redis can manifest as slow UI performance, failing background jobs, or inability to log in. Careful monitoring of Redis memory usage, client connections, and command latency is essential.
```

### 3.5. Sidekiq: The Background Job Processor

- Role & Responsibilities:
    
    Sidekiq is a Ruby framework designed for efficient background job processing.7 Within GitLab, it plays a crucial role in handling tasks asynchronously, meaning these tasks are executed separately from the main web request-response cycle. This prevents long-running operations from blocking the user interface or API responses, thereby improving perceived performance and system responsiveness.27
    
    Common background jobs handled by Sidekiq include:
    
    - Sending email notifications.
    - Executing CI/CD pipeline stages and jobs.
    - Processing webhooks.
    - Updating merge request diffs.
    - Importing and exporting projects or groups.
    - Performing repository maintenance tasks (e.g., garbage collection).
    - Synchronizing data with external systems (e.g., LDAP sync).
    
    Sidekiq workers pull jobs from various queues stored in Redis.27 GitLab allows for sophisticated configuration of Sidekiq, including running multiple Sidekiq processes, each potentially dedicated to handling specific queues. This enables scaling of background job processing capabilities based on workload demands.35 All Sidekiq workers in GitLab should inherit from `ApplicationWorker`, which provides additional GitLab-specific functionalities and routing.27
    
- **Key Interactions:**
    
    - **Redis:** This is Sidekiq's primary dependency. It uses Redis to store job queues, job arguments, status information, and retry metadata. Sidekiq workers continuously poll Redis for new jobs.27
    - **GitLab-rails (Puma):** The Rails application is responsible for enqueuing jobs into Redis. Sidekiq worker processes load the GitLab Rails application environment to execute these jobs, meaning they have access to the same models, services, and business logic as the Puma processes.27
    - **PostgreSQL:** Many background jobs require interaction with the PostgreSQL database to fetch data needed for processing or to update records upon job completion (e.g., updating the status of a CI job, recording the result of an import).28
    - **Gitaly:** Jobs that involve Git repository operations (e.g., CI jobs fetching source code, repository mirroring, garbage collection) will interact with Gitaly (or Praefect) via gRPC calls.28
- Core gitlab.rb Configuration Snippets:
    
    Sidekiq's behavior, including the number of processes and their queue assignments, is configured in /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb.28
    
    - Enabling/disabling Sidekiq (enabled by default):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        sidekiq['enable'] = true
        ```
        
    - Configuring multiple Sidekiq processes and their queue groups 35:
        - To create multiple processes, each handling all available queues (e.g., 2 processes):
            
            Ruby
            
            ```
            sidekiq['queue_groups'] = ['*'] * 2
            ```
            
        - To create processes dedicated to specific queues:
            
            Ruby
            
            ```
            sidekiq['queue_groups'] = [
              'urgent_cpu_bound,urgent_other', # Process 1 for high-priority CPU-bound queues
              'default,mailers',               # Process 2 for general tasks and mailers
              '*'                              # Process 3 as a catch-all for any other queues
            ]
            ```
            
            The `*` wildcard means the process will listen to all queues not explicitly named in other groups.
    - Setting concurrency (number of threads) per Sidekiq process 35:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        sidekiq['concurrency'] = 20 # Each Sidekiq process will use 20 threads
        ```
        
        By default, if `concurrency` is not set, each process starts with a number of threads equal to the number of queues it listens to, plus one spare, up to a maximum of 50.35
    - Configuring the Sidekiq metrics server for Prometheus 28:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        sidekiq['metrics_enabled'] = true
        sidekiq['listen_address'] = "localhost" # Address for metrics server to listen on
        sidekiq['listen_port'] = 8082          # Port for metrics server
        sidekiq['exporter_log_enabled'] = true # Optionally log metrics server activity
        ```
        
    - Configuring Sidekiq health checks 28:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        sidekiq['health_checks_enabled'] = true
        sidekiq['health_checks_listen_address'] = "localhost"
        sidekiq['health_checks_listen_port'] = 8092
        ```
        
    - Log settings:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # sidekiq['log_directory'] = "/var/log/gitlab/sidekiq" # Default
        # sidekiq['log_level'] = "INFO"
        ```
        
    - Example configuration:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
        sidekiq['enable'] = true
        
        # Example: Start 2 Sidekiq processes.
        # Process 1 handles 'pipeline_processing' and 'project_export' queues.
        # Process 2 handles all other queues ('*').
        sidekiq['queue_groups'] = [
          "pipeline_processing,project_export",
          "*"
        ]
        # Set 15 threads for each of these Sidekiq processes
        sidekiq['concurrency'] = 15
        
        # Enable Prometheus metrics for Sidekiq
        sidekiq['metrics_enabled'] = true
        sidekiq['listen_address'] = "localhost" # Or '0.0.0.0' to listen on all interfaces
        sidekiq['listen_port'] = 8082
        
        # Enable health checks for Sidekiq
        sidekiq['health_checks_enabled'] = true
        sidekiq['health_checks_listen_address'] = "localhost"
        sidekiq['health_checks_listen_port'] = 8092
        ```
        
    
    The ability to define `queue_groups` and assign them to different Sidekiq processes is a powerful feature for managing resource allocation and ensuring that high-priority jobs are not starved by lower-priority, long-running tasks. This level of control is particularly important in large, busy GitLab instances where the volume and variety of background jobs can be substantial. Misconfiguration or under-provisioning of Sidekiq resources can lead to significant job processing delays, impacting user experience and system operations.
    
- Administration & Usage:
    
    Sidekiq is managed using gitlab-ctl, and its activity can be monitored through the GitLab UI and logs.5
    
    - Restarting Sidekiq: `sudo gitlab-ctl restart sidekiq`.
    - Checking Sidekiq status: `sudo gitlab-ctl status sidekiq`.
    - Applying configuration changes: `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.
    - Log location: `/var/log/gitlab/sidekiq/` contains the logs for Sidekiq processes.6
    - Monitoring background jobs: The GitLab Admin Area provides a UI for viewing background job queues, processed jobs, and failed jobs (Admin Area > Monitoring > Background Jobs).35
    - Troubleshooting with `sidekiq-cluster`: For debugging purposes, administrators can directly use the `/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails/bin/sidekiq-cluster` command to start and manage Sidekiq processes, though `gitlab.rb` is the recommended configuration method.35
- **Table: Key `sidekiq[...]` settings in `gitlab.rb`**
    

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Setting**|**Description**|**Example Value**|
|`enable`|Enables or disables the Sidekiq service.|`true`|
|`queue_groups`|Array defining Sidekiq processes and the queues they listen to. Each string is a process.|`['*', 'project_import,project_export']`|
|`concurrency`|Number of threads per Sidekiq process.|`25`|
|`metrics_enabled`|Enables the Prometheus metrics server for Sidekiq.|`true`|
|`listen_address` (for metrics)|IP address the Sidekiq metrics server listens on.|`"localhost"` or `"0.0.0.0"`|
|`listen_port` (for metrics)|Port for the Sidekiq metrics server.|`8082`|
|`health_checks_enabled`|Enables the health check server for Sidekiq.|`true`|
|`health_checks_listen_address`|IP address the Sidekiq health check server listens on.|`"localhost"`|
|`health_checks_listen_port`|Port for the Sidekiq health check server.|`8092`|
|`shutdown_timeout`|Time in seconds Sidekiq workers have to finish jobs before being forcefully terminated during shutdown.|`25`|
|`log_level`|Logging level for Sidekiq processes.|`"INFO"`|

```
Effective Sidekiq configuration and monitoring are essential for a smoothly operating GitLab instance. Queue lengths, job failure rates, and processing latencies are key indicators of Sidekiq health and the overall system's capacity to handle background workloads.
```

### 3.6. Gitaly: Git RPC Service

- Role & Responsibilities:
    
    Gitaly is a dedicated service developed by GitLab to provide robust, high-level Remote Procedure Call (RPC) access to Git repositories.7 Its introduction was a significant architectural change aimed at improving the scalability, reliability, and performance of Git operations within GitLab.
    
    Key responsibilities include:
    
    - **Abstracting Git Access:** Gitaly acts as an intermediary layer between GitLab application components (Rails, Shell, Workhorse) and the actual Git repositories on disk. This means application components no longer access Git repositories directly via the file system.25
    - **Handling All Git Operations:** All Git-related actions, such as cloning, fetching, pushing, reading commit data, diffing, and branching, are performed through RPC calls to Gitaly.25
    - **Enabling Horizontal Scaling:** By decoupling Git operations into a separate service, Gitaly allows for the distribution of Git storage and processing across multiple dedicated Gitaly servers, which is crucial for large GitLab deployments.25
    - **Eliminating NFS Dependency:** Historically, GitLab relied on Network File System (NFS) for shared Git repository access in multi-node setups. Gitaly was designed to remove this dependency, as NFS often became a performance bottleneck and a single point of failure.25
    - **Supporting Multiple Repository Storages:** Gitaly can manage repositories across several distinct storage paths, which can be configured on the same or different Gitaly servers. This allows for sharding repositories based on various criteria.9
- **Key Interactions:**
    
    - **GitLab-rails (Puma):** The Rails application is a primary client of Gitaly. It makes gRPC calls to Gitaly servers to perform any action that requires reading from or writing to a Git repository.25
    - **GitLab Shell:** When users interact with GitLab via SSH for Git operations (e.g., `git clone user@gitlab.example.com:group/project.git`), GitLab Shell receives these commands and then makes gRPC calls to the appropriate Gitaly server to execute them.25
    - **GitLab-workhorse:** For Git operations over HTTP/S, Workhorse, after receiving authorization from Rails, can communicate directly with Gitaly via gRPC to stream repository data (e.g., during a `git clone` or `git push`).13
    - **Praefect:** In a Gitaly Cluster configuration, Praefect acts as a reverse proxy and transaction manager in front of multiple Gitaly nodes. All client requests (from Rails, Shell, Workhorse) are directed to Praefect, which then routes them to the appropriate Gitaly node and manages replication.25
    - **File System:** Gitaly directly reads from and writes to the Git repositories stored on the disk locations defined in its configuration.9
- Core gitlab.rb Configuration Snippets:
    
    Gitaly's configuration in /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb defines its listening addresses, authentication, storage paths, and other operational parameters.9
    
    - Enabling Gitaly (enabled by default):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        gitaly['enable'] = true
        ```
        
    - Gitaly listen address and port (for gRPC connections):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        gitaly['configuration'][:listen_addr] = 'localhost:8075' # Default for single-node
        # For multi-node, typically '0.0.0.0:8075' to listen on all interfaces
        ```
        
    - TLS configuration for secure gRPC:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # gitaly['configuration'][:tls_listen_addr] = '0.0.0.0:8076'
        # gitaly['configuration'][:tls][:certificate_path] = '/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitaly.crt'
        # gitaly['configuration'][:tls][:key_path] = '/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitaly.key'
        ```
        
    - Authentication token (this token must be shared with all Gitaly clients like Rails, Shell, Workhorse, and Praefect):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        gitaly['configuration'][:auth][:token] = 'your-very-secret-gitaly-auth-token'
        # gitaly['configuration'][:auth][:transitioning] = false # Set to true during token rotation
        ```
        
    - Defining repository storage paths 9:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        gitaly['configuration'][:storage] = [
          { 'name' => 'default', 'path' => '/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories' },
          # Example for an additional storage path
          # { 'name' => 'storage1', 'path' => '/mnt/fast_ssd_storage/git-data/repositories' }
        ]
        ```
        
    - Prometheus metrics endpoint:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        gitaly['configuration'][:prometheus_listen_addr] = "localhost:9236"
        ```
        
    - GitLab Shell secret token (used for Gitaly to make authenticated callbacks to the GitLab internal API via GitLab Shell, must match `gitlab_shell['secret_token']` on Rails nodes):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # This is often configured under gitlab_shell settings and Gitaly reads it,
        # or might need to be explicitly set if Gitaly is on a separate node.
        # gitlab_shell['secret_token'] = 'shell_secret'
        # gitaly['configuration'][:gitlab_shell][:secret_token] = 'shell_secret'
        ```
        
    - Example for a standalone Gitaly server (or the Gitaly component on a single-node GitLab):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
        gitaly['enable'] = true
        gitaly['configuration'] = {
          # Listen on all interfaces if Gitaly is on a separate server and accessed over the network
          # For a single-node install, 'localhost:8075' is often sufficient.
          listen_addr: "0.0.0.0:8075",
          auth: {
            token: 'highlysecretgitalytoken123' # This token must be known by GitLab Rails
          },
          storage: [
            {
              name: 'default', # Logical name for this storage
              path: '/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories' # Actual path on disk
            }
            # Add more storage locations if needed:
            # {
            #   name: 'storage_fast',
            #   path: '/mnt/nvme_drive/gitlab_repositories'
            # }
          ],
          prometheus_listen_addr: "localhost:9236" # For Prometheus metrics scraping
        }
        
        # On the GitLab Rails application nodes, you would configure connection to this Gitaly:
        # git_data_dirs({
        #   "default" => { "gitaly_address" => "tcp://<IP_OF_GITALY_SERVER>:8075" },
        #   # "storage_fast" => { "gitaly_address" => "tcp://<IP_OF_GITALY_SERVER>:8075" } # Or a different Gitaly server
        # })
        # gitlab_rails['gitaly_token'] = 'highlysecretgitalytoken123' # Must match Gitaly's auth token
        
        # Newer GitLab versions use gitlab_rails['repositories_storages']:
        # gitlab_rails['repositories_storages'] = {
        #   'default' => {
        #     'gitaly_address' => 'tcp://<IP_OF_GITALY_SERVER>:8075',
        #     'gitaly_token' => 'highlysecretgitalytoken123'
        #   },
        #   'storage_fast' => {
        #     'gitaly_address' => 'tcp://<IP_OF_GITALY_SERVER>:8075', # Or a different Gitaly server
        #     'gitaly_token' => 'highlysecretgitalytoken123'
        #   }
        # }
        ```
        
    
    The move to Gitaly was a pivotal architectural decision, addressing critical scalability and reliability concerns tied to direct file system access (especially over NFS). By centralizing Git operations through an RPC service, GitLab gained the ability to scale Git storage and processing independently of the main application servers. The authentication token (`gitaly['configuration'][:auth][:token]`) is a cornerstone of security in distributed Gitaly deployments, ensuring that only authorized GitLab components can interact with the repositories.
    
- Administration & Usage:
    
    Gitaly service management and diagnostics are performed using gitlab-ctl and Gitaly's own command-line tools.6
    
    - Restarting Gitaly: `sudo gitlab-ctl restart gitaly`.
    - Checking Gitaly status: `sudo gitlab-ctl status gitaly`.
    - Applying configuration changes: `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.
    - Log location: `/var/log/gitlab/gitaly/` contains Gitaly service logs.6
    - Gitaly CLI for diagnostics:
        - `sudo /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/gitaly check /var/opt/gitlab/gitaly/config.toml` (on Gitaly server, for GitLab 15.3+) to validate configuration and connectivity to GitLab internal API.25
        - `sudo /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/gitaly-hooks check /var/opt/gitlab/gitaly/config.toml` (on Gitaly server, for GitLab 15.2 and earlier).26
    - Upgrade considerations: When upgrading GitLab, Gitaly servers should generally be upgraded before the application servers (Rails, Workhorse, Shell) to ensure client-server compatibility for gRPC calls.40

```
Gitaly is fundamental to GitLab's ability to manage Git repositories at scale. Its proper configuration, especially regarding network accessibility, authentication, and storage paths, is critical for the stability and performance of any GitLab instance.

### 3.7. Praefect: Gitaly High Availability Manager

- Role & Responsibilities:
    
    Praefect is a crucial component for achieving high availability (HA) and horizontal scalability for Git repository storage in GitLab. It acts as a reverse proxy and transaction manager specifically for Gitaly, forming what is known as a Gitaly Cluster.7
    
    Key responsibilities include:
    
    - **Request Routing:** Praefect intercepts all Git-related RPCs from GitLab application components (Rails, Workhorse, Shell) and routes them to one of several Gitaly nodes that belong to a "virtual storage".37
    - **Data Replication:** It manages the replication of repository data. Write operations are typically sent to a primary Gitaly node and then asynchronously or synchronously replicated by Praefect to secondary Gitaly nodes within the same virtual storage.25
    - **Consistency Management:** Praefect ensures data consistency across replicas. This can range from eventual consistency to strong consistency, depending on the configuration and operation type. Strong consistency aims to prevent data loss by ensuring writes are confirmed on a quorum of nodes.25
    - **Automatic Failover:** Praefect monitors the health of Gitaly nodes. If a primary Gitaly node becomes unavailable, Praefect can automatically promote one of the healthy secondary nodes to become the new primary, thus maintaining service availability.25
    - **Read Distribution:** Praefect can distribute read requests across healthy, up-to-date Gitaly replicas, which can improve performance for read-heavy workloads.25
    - **Metadata Storage:** Praefect uses its own PostgreSQL database to store metadata about the Gitaly Cluster, including repository locations, replication status, primary assignments, and health check information.25
- **Key Interactions:**
    
    - **GitLab application components (Rails, Workhorse, Shell):** These components act as clients to Praefect. Instead of connecting directly to Gitaly nodes, they connect to Praefect (or a load balancer in front of multiple Praefect nodes). Praefect's address is configured in GitLab Rails as the Gitaly address for a virtual storage.37
    - **Gitaly nodes:** Praefect communicates with all Gitaly nodes within its configured virtual storages. It sends them RPCs, monitors their health, and coordinates data replication between them.25
    - **PostgreSQL Database:** Praefect reads from and writes to its dedicated PostgreSQL database to manage cluster state and repository metadata.25
    - **Load Balancer (optional but recommended for HA):** In a production Gitaly Cluster, multiple Praefect nodes are typically deployed behind a load balancer to provide HA for Praefect itself.38
- Core gitlab.rb Configuration Snippets:
    
    Configuring a Gitaly Cluster with Praefect involves settings on Praefect nodes, Gitaly nodes, and GitLab application nodes.38
    
    - **On Praefect nodes:**
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb on a Praefect node
        praefect['enable'] = true
        # Praefect nodes should not run Gitaly or other GitLab services
        # gitlab_rails['enable'] = false
        # gitaly['enable'] = false
        # puma['enable'] = false
        # sidekiq['enable'] = false
        # etc.
        
        praefect['configuration'] = {
          listen_addr: '0.0.0.0:2305', # Praefect listens for client connections
          # tls_listen_addr: '0.0.0.0:3305', # For TLS client connections
          # tls: {
          #   certificate_path: '/etc/gitlab/ssl/praefect.crt',
          #   key_path: '/etc/gitlab/ssl/praefect.key'
          # },
          auth: {
            token: 'PRAEFECT_EXTERNAL_TOKEN_FOR_CLIENTS', # Token for GitLab app to connect to Praefect
            transitioning: false
          },
          database: {
            host: 'your_praefect_db_host.example.com',
            port: 5432,
            user: 'praefect_user',
            password: 'praefect_db_password',
            dbname: 'praefect_production',
            # sslmode: 'require' # if DB connection requires SSL
          },
          virtual_storage:,
              # default_replication_factor: 3 # Optional: Number of replicas for new repositories
            }
          ],
          failover_enabled: true,
          # error_on_write_not_fully_replicated: true, # For stronger consistency
          prometheus_listen_addr: '0.0.0.0:9652' # For Prometheus metrics
        }
        
        # Praefect needs its own PostgreSQL database, distinct from GitLab's main DB.
        # postgresql['enable'] = false # If using an external DB for Praefect
        ```
        
    - **On Gitaly nodes (part of the Praefect cluster):**
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb on a Gitaly node
        gitaly['enable'] = true
        # These Gitaly nodes should not run Praefect or other GitLab services
        # praefect['enable'] = false
        # gitlab_rails['enable'] = false
        # etc.
        
        gitaly['configuration'] = {
          listen_addr: '0.0.0.0:8075',
          # tls_listen_addr, tls settings if Praefect connects via TLS
          auth: {
            token: 'PRAEFECT_INTERNAL_TOKEN_FOR_GITALY_NODES', # Must match token in Praefect's config for this node
            transitioning: false
          },
          storage: [
            {
              name: 'gitaly-1', # Unique name for this Gitaly node's storage, must match Praefect config
              path: '/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories'
            }
            # For gitaly-2, this would be 'gitaly-2', etc.
          ],
          prometheus_listen_addr: '0.0.0.0:9236'
        }
        # GitLab Shell needs to make callbacks to GitLab Rails
        gitlab_rails['internal_api_url'] = 'https://gitlab.example.com'
        gitlab_shell['secret_token'] = 'GITLAB_SHELL_SECRET_TOKEN_SHARED_ACROSS_ALL_NODES'
        ```
        
    - **On GitLab Rails/application nodes:**
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb on a GitLab Rails node
        # Disable local Gitaly if not used
        # gitaly['enable'] = false
        
        gitlab_rails['repositories_storages'] = {
          'default' => { # Must match virtual_storage name in Praefect config
            # Address of Praefect (or its load balancer)
            'gitaly_address' => 'tcp://praefect-lb.example.com:2305',
            'gitaly_token' => 'PRAEFECT_EXTERNAL_TOKEN_FOR_CLIENTS' # Must match Praefect's external auth token
          }
        }
        gitlab_shell['secret_token'] = 'GITLAB_SHELL_SECRET_TOKEN_SHARED_ACROSS_ALL_NODES'
        ```
        
    
    Praefect introduces a layer of complexity compared to a single Gitaly setup, primarily due to the additional Praefect service itself, its PostgreSQL database dependency, and the need for careful token management (Praefect's external token for clients, and internal tokens for communication with Gitaly nodes). However, this complexity is the price for achieving robust high availability and improved read performance for Git repositories, which are often the most critical and resource-intensive part of a GitLab installation. The separation of concerns, with Praefect handling routing and replication logic, allows Gitaly nodes to focus purely on Git operations.
    
- Administration & Usage:
    
    Managing a Praefect cluster involves gitlab-ctl commands on relevant nodes and specific Praefect CLI tools.38
    
    - Restarting Praefect: `sudo gitlab-ctl restart praefect`.
    - Checking Praefect status: `sudo gitlab-ctl status praefect`.
    - Applying configuration changes: `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` (must be run on Praefect, Gitaly, and GitLab Rails nodes after respective `gitlab.rb` changes).
    - Log location: `/var/log/gitlab/praefect/` on Praefect nodes.
    - **Praefect Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Used for advanced diagnostics and management. Accessed via `sudo -u git /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/praefect -config /var/opt/gitlab/praefect/config.toml <subcommand>`.42
        - `sql-ping`: Checks database connectivity.
        - `dial-nodes`: Checks connectivity to all configured Gitaly nodes.
        - `dataloss`: Identifies repositories that might have inconsistent data across replicas (e.g., if a primary failed before all writes were replicated).
        - `list-untracked-repositories`: Finds repositories on Gitaly nodes not tracked by Praefect.
        - `remove-repository`: Removes a repository from the Praefect database and optionally from disk.
        - `set-replication-factor`: Changes the desired number of replicas for a repository.
    - **`gitlab-ctl praefect check`:** A comprehensive health check command that runs several diagnostic tests on the Praefect cluster, including migration status, node connectivity, database access, and repository accessibility.42
- **Table: Key `praefect['configuration'][...]` settings in `gitlab.rb` (on Praefect nodes)**
    

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Setting Path**|**Description**|**Example Value**|
|`listen_addr`|Network address and port Praefect listens on for client (GitLab app) connections.|`'0.0.0.0:2305'`|
|`auth: { token:... }`|External authentication token used by GitLab application components to connect to Praefect.|`'PRAEFECT_EXTERNAL_TOKEN'`|
|`database: { host:..., port:...,... }`|Connection details for Praefect's PostgreSQL database (host, port, user, password, dbname).|`{ host: 'db.praefect', user: 'praefect',... }`|
|`virtual_storage: [ { name:..., node: [... ] } ]`|Defines virtual storages and maps them to physical Gitaly nodes with their addresses and internal authentication tokens.|`}]`|
|`failover_enabled`|Enables or disables automatic failover to a secondary Gitaly node if a primary fails.|`true`|
|`prometheus_listen_addr`|Network address and port for Praefect's Prometheus metrics endpoint.|`'0.0.0.0:9652'`|
|`reconciliation: { scheduling_interval:... }`|Configures how often Praefect checks for and reconciles inconsistencies between replicas.|`{ scheduling_interval: '5m' }`|

```
Praefect is GitLab's sophisticated answer to the challenge of making Git storage highly available and scalable. Its introduction fundamentally changes the Gitaly architecture for deployments requiring these characteristics, adding a management and coordination layer that is essential for fault tolerance and data integrity in a distributed Git environment.
```

### 3.8. Prometheus: Metrics Collection and Monitoring

- Role & Responsibilities:
    
    Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit, widely adopted for its powerful data model and query language (PromQL). Within GitLab Omnibus, Prometheus is bundled to provide comprehensive, out-of-the-box monitoring of the GitLab instance itself and its various components.7
    
    Its core responsibilities include:
    
    - **Metrics Collection:** Periodically "scrapes" (pulls) metrics from various instrumented jobs or exporters associated with GitLab components. These metrics are time-series data, meaning sequences of data points indexed by time.17
    - **Metrics Storage:** Stores the collected time-series data in its local database. Retention policies can be configured to manage disk usage.17
    - **Alerting:** Allows defining alert rules based on PromQL expressions. When these rules are met (e.g., high error rates, low disk space), Prometheus can send alerts to an Alertmanager instance for processing and notification.43
    - **Querying:** Provides PromQL for powerful ad-hoc querying and exploration of collected metrics.
    - **Service Discovery:** Can be configured to automatically discover scrape targets.
- **Key Interactions:**
    
    - **Exporters:** Prometheus interacts with a variety of exporters, which are specialized services or built-in endpoints that expose metrics in a format Prometheus can understand. Key exporters in a GitLab Omnibus setup include:
        - **`node_exporter`:** Exposes a wide range of hardware and OS metrics from the host system(s) (CPU, memory, disk, network).7
        - **`postgres_exporter`:** Provides metrics from the PostgreSQL database (e.g., connection counts, query performance, replication status).7
        - **`redis_exporter`:** Exposes metrics from Redis (e.g., memory usage, connected clients, command latency).7
        - **`gitlab-exporter`:** A specific exporter for GitLab that gathers metrics from various GitLab application aspects, often by querying the database or Redis (e.g., Sidekiq queue lengths, repository counts, user statistics).7
        - **Gitaly:** Gitaly nodes expose their own metrics endpoint that Prometheus can scrape directly (e.g., RPC latencies, operation counts).7
        - **GitLab-workhorse:** Workhorse has a built-in Prometheus metrics endpoint.7
        - **Puma:** The Puma web server running GitLab Rails also exposes its own metrics (e.g., request rates, queue depths).7
        - **Sidekiq:** Sidekiq processes can expose metrics about job processing rates, queue sizes, and worker status.17
        - **Praefect:** Praefect nodes in a Gitaly Cluster expose metrics related to request routing, replication, and node health.38
    - **Alertmanager:** When alerting rules defined in Prometheus are triggered, Prometheus sends these alerts to a configured Alertmanager instance. Alertmanager then handles deduplication, grouping, silencing, and routing of alerts to various notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.).7
    - **Grafana (Historically Bundled, or External):** Prometheus serves as a primary data source for Grafana (or other visualization tools). Grafana queries Prometheus using PromQL to create dashboards and visualize the collected metrics, providing insights into the health and performance of the GitLab instance.7
- Core gitlab.rb Configuration Snippets:
    
    Prometheus and its related components are configured via /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb.17
    
    - Enabling/disabling overall Prometheus monitoring (includes Prometheus server and most exporters):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        prometheus_monitoring['enable'] = true # Default is true
        # To disable all Prometheus monitoring:
        # prometheus_monitoring['enable'] = false
        ```
        
        17
    - Enabling/disabling the Prometheus server itself (if `prometheus_monitoring` is true, this is also true by default):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        prometheus['enable'] = true
        ```
        
    - Prometheus listen address and port:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        prometheus['listen_address'] = 'localhost:9090' # Default, only accessible locally
        # To allow external access:
        # prometheus['listen_address'] = '0.0.0.0:9090'
        ```
        
        17
    - Configuring custom scrape targets (Prometheus will automatically scrape bundled exporters if `prometheus_monitoring` is enabled):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        prometheus['scrape_configs'] = [
          {
            'job_name' => 'my_custom_service',
            'static_configs' => [
              'targets' => ['app1.example.com:9100', 'app2.example.com:9100']
          }
        ]
        ```
        
        44
    - Specifying Prometheus recording and alerting rules files:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        prometheus['rules_files'] =
        ```
        
        43
    - Setting external labels for all metrics scraped by this Prometheus instance:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        prometheus['external_labels'] = {
          'cluster' => 'gitlab-main',
          'replica' => 'a'
        }
        ```
        
        43
    - Configuring Prometheus flags (e.g., data retention):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        prometheus['flags'] = {
          'storage.tsdb.path' => '/var/opt/gitlab/prometheus/data', # Default data path
          'storage.tsdb.retention.time' => '30d', # Retain data for 30 days
          'web.listen-address' => prometheus['listen_address'] # Ensure flag matches listen_address
        }
        ```
        
        17
    - Alertmanager configuration:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        alertmanager['enable'] = true
        alertmanager['listen_address'] = 'localhost:9093' # Default
        alertmanager['global'] = { 'smtp_hello' => 'gitlab.example.com' }
        alertmanager['receivers'] = [
          {
            'name' => 'default-receiver',
            'email_configs' => [{ 'to' => 'admin@example.com' }]
          }
        ]
        alertmanager['routes'] = [ { 'receiver' => 'default-receiver' } ]
        ```
        
        43
    - Configuration for individual exporters (usually enabled by `prometheus_monitoring['enable']`, but can be fine-tuned or configured to listen on specific addresses if using an external Prometheus server):
        - `node_exporter['enable'] = true`, `node_exporter['listen_address'] = '0.0.0.0:9100'`.17
        - `gitlab_exporter['enable'] = true`, `gitlab_exporter['listen_address'] = '0.0.0.0'`, `gitlab_exporter['listen_port'] = '9168'`.17
        - `redis_exporter['enable'] = true`, `redis_exporter['listen_address'] = '0.0.0.0:9121'`.44
        - `postgres_exporter['enable'] = true`, `postgres_exporter['listen_address'] = '0.0.0.0:9187'`.44
    - Example configuration:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
        # Enable Prometheus and its bundled exporters
        prometheus_monitoring['enable'] = true
        
        # Prometheus server settings
        prometheus['listen_address'] = 'localhost:9090' # Default, only accessible from the GitLab server itself
        prometheus['flags'] = {
          'storage.tsdb.retention.time' => '15d', # Keep metrics for 15 days
          'config.file' => '/var/opt/gitlab/prometheus/prometheus.yml' # Main Prometheus config file
        }
        
        # Example for adding a custom scrape configuration for an external service
        # prometheus['scrape_configs'] = [
        #   {
        #     'job_name' => 'my_external_app_metrics',
        #     'metrics_path' => '/metrics',
        #     'static_configs' => [
        #       'targets' => ['external-app.example.com:8080']
        #     ]
        #   }
        # ]
        
        # Alertmanager settings
        alertmanager['enable'] = true
        # alertmanager['listen_address'] = 'localhost:9093'
        # alertmanager['admin_email'] = 'alertadmin@example.com'
        # More complex receiver and routing rules can be defined as per documentation.
        ```
        
    
    The integration of Prometheus into GitLab Omnibus provides a powerful, self-contained monitoring solution. Administrators gain immediate visibility into the performance and health of their GitLab instance without needing to set up a separate monitoring stack from scratch for basic needs. The deprecation and removal of the bundled Grafana instance 51 further underscores the importance of understanding Prometheus itself, as administrators may need to query it directly or connect their own external Grafana (or other visualization tools) to it.
    
- Administration & Usage:
    
    Prometheus and Alertmanager services are managed via gitlab-ctl.6
    
    - Restarting Prometheus: `sudo gitlab-ctl restart prometheus`.
    - Restarting Alertmanager: `sudo gitlab-ctl restart alertmanager`.
    - Checking status: `sudo gitlab-ctl status prometheus`, `sudo gitlab-ctl status alertmanager`.
    - Applying configuration changes: `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.
    - Log locations: `/var/log/gitlab/prometheus/` and `/var/log/gitlab/alertmanager/`.6 Log for exporters are typically in `/var/log/gitlab/<exporter_name>/`.
    - Accessing Prometheus Web UI: `http://<prometheus_listen_address>` (e.g., `http://localhost:9090`). From here, metrics can be queried using PromQL, and scrape target status can be checked.
    - Deleting Prometheus data (e.g., to reset or reclaim disk space): Stop Prometheus, delete the contents of `/var/opt/gitlab/prometheus/data`, then start Prometheus.17

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Setting**|**Description**|**Example Value**|
|`prometheus_monitoring['enable']`|Globally enables/disables Prometheus and most bundled exporters.|`true`|
|`prometheus['enable']`|Enables/disables the Prometheus server itself.|`true`|
|`prometheus['listen_address']`|IP address and port Prometheus server listens on.|`'localhost:9090'` or `'0.0.0.0:9090'`|

|`alertmanager['enable']`|Enables/disables the Alertmanager service.|`true`|
|`alertmanager['listen_address']`|IP address and port Alertmanager listens on.|`'localhost:9093'`|
|`alertmanager['receivers']`|Array defining alert notification receivers (e.g., email, Slack).|`[{ 'name': 'email_admin', 'email_configs': [...] }]`|
|`alertmanager['routes']`|Array defining how alerts are routed to receivers based on labels.|`[{ 'receiver': 'email_admin', 'match': { 'severity': 'critical' } }]`|

```
The Prometheus setup within Omnibus GitLab is designed to be largely self-sufficient for monitoring the instance itself. Understanding its configuration allows administrators to extend its capabilities, integrate it with external systems, and effectively manage alerting for their GitLab environment.
```

### 3.9. Grafana: Visualizing Metrics (Historical Context and Deprecation)

- Role & Responsibilities (Historical):
    
    Grafana is a widely used open-source platform for analytics and interactive visualization, particularly well-suited for time-series data like the metrics collected by Prometheus.7 In older versions of GitLab Omnibus (prior to GitLab 16.0), Grafana was bundled and pre-configured to provide visual dashboards for the metrics collected by the embedded Prometheus instance.47
    
    Its historical role included:
    
    - **Metrics Visualization:** Providing graphical representations (charts, graphs, tables) of GitLab performance and system health metrics from Prometheus.
    - **Pre-configured Dashboards:** Shipping with a set of default dashboards tailored for monitoring various aspects of GitLab, such as Nginx performance, Puma throughput, Sidekiq queue lengths, and Gitaly latencies.47
    - **Custom Dashboards:** Allowing administrators to create their own custom dashboards to visualize specific metrics relevant to their environment.
    - **User Authentication:** Often integrated with GitLab itself for OAuth2 authentication, allowing GitLab users to access Grafana dashboards with their GitLab credentials.47
- Deprecation and Removal:
    
    The version of Grafana bundled with GitLab Omnibus was deprecated in GitLab 16.0 and subsequently removed in GitLab 16.3.47
    
    The primary reason for this change was that the bundled version of Grafana was no longer a supported version by the Grafana project itself, posing potential maintenance and security concerns.51
    
    Users who were relying on the bundled Grafana are advised to migrate to:
    
    1. A self-managed, external Grafana instance (which can still connect to the GitLab-bundled Prometheus as a data source).
    2. An alternative observability platform of their choice.51 GitLab documentation provided guidance for temporarily re-enabling the bundled Grafana in versions 16.0 through 16.2 for users needing more time to transition.51
- **Key Interactions (Historical):**
    
    - **Prometheus:** Grafana's primary interaction was with the bundled Prometheus server. It acted as a client to Prometheus, querying it using PromQL to fetch time-series data for display on dashboards.17
    - **Nginx:** Access to the Grafana UI was typically proxied through the bundled Nginx, often available at a subpath of the main GitLab URL (e.g., `https://gitlab.example.com/-/grafana`).47
    - **GitLab OAuth (GitLab-rails):** If configured, Grafana would interact with the GitLab Rails application for user authentication via OAuth2. Users logging into Grafana would be redirected to GitLab for authentication and then back to Grafana upon successful login.47
- Core gitlab.rb Configuration Snippets (Historical - for versions < 16.3):
    
    These settings in /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb were used to configure the bundled Grafana.47
    
    - Enabling Grafana:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # grafana['enable'] = true # In older versions, this enabled Grafana
        ```
        
    - Setting the initial admin password (only effective on the first reconfigure after enabling):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # grafana['admin_password'] = 'your_secure_grafana_admin_password'
        ```
        
    - Allowing username/password login form (alongside GitLab OAuth):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # grafana['disable_login_form'] = false
        ```
        
    - Configuring GitLab as an OAuth provider:
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # grafana['gitlab_application_id'] = 'YOUR_GITLAB_OAUTH_APP_ID'
        # grafana['gitlab_secret'] = 'YOUR_GITLAB_OAUTH_APP_SECRET'
        # grafana['allowed_groups'] = ['gitlab-admins', 'developers'] # Optional: restrict login to specific GitLab groups
        ```
        
    - The Grafana URL was typically derived from `external_url` and `grafana['home_url']` (defaulting to `/-/grafana`).
    - Example (historical configuration):
        
        Ruby
        
        ```
        # /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb (HISTORICAL - for versions < 16.3 where bundled Grafana was available)
        # external_url 'https://gitlab.example.com' # Grafana URL would be https://gitlab.example.com/-/grafana
        
        # grafana['enable'] = true
        # grafana['admin_password'] = 'ChangeThisDefaultPassword!' # Set on first enable
        
        # To allow admin login using username/password, alongside GitLab OAuth:
        # grafana['disable_login_form'] = false
        
        # For GitLab OAuth integration:
        # First, create an OAuth application in GitLab Admin Area > Applications
        # Use callback URL like: https://gitlab.example.com/-/grafana/login/gitlab
        # grafana['gitlab_application_id'] = 'paste_application_id_here'
        # grafana['gitlab_secret'] = 'paste_secret_here'
        # grafana['allowed_groups'] = ['monitoring-team'] # Optional: Restrict access to specific GitLab groups
        ```
        
    
    The removal of bundled Grafana marks a significant change in how monitoring visualization is handled with GitLab Omnibus. While GitLab continues to provide robust metrics collection via Prometheus, users now have the responsibility and flexibility to choose and manage their own visualization tools. This aligns with a broader trend of decoupling components and allowing users more control over their specific operational stacks.
    
- Administration & Usage (Historical):
    
    Management of the bundled Grafana was done via gitlab-ctl.47
    
    - Restarting Grafana: `sudo gitlab-ctl restart grafana`.
    - Checking Grafana status: `sudo gitlab-ctl status grafana`.
    - Applying configuration changes: `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.
    - Log location: `/var/log/gitlab/grafana/`.
    - Accessing Grafana UI: Typically `https://<your_gitlab_domain>/-/grafana`.
    - Resetting admin password: `sudo gitlab-ctl set-grafana-password` or using the `grafana-cli admin reset-admin-password` command.47
- **Table: Key `grafana[...]` settings in `gitlab.rb` (Historical)**
    

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Setting**|**Description**|**Example Value**|
|`enable`|Enabled or disabled the bundled Grafana service. (Now deprecated/removed)|`true`|
|`admin_password`|Initial password for the Grafana `admin` user. Set before first reconfigure. (Now deprecated/removed)|`'supersecret'`|
|`disable_login_form`|If `false`, allowed direct username/password login to Grafana. (Now deprecated/removed)|`false`|
|`gitlab_application_id`|OAuth Application ID from GitLab for GitLab SSO to Grafana. (Now deprecated/removed)|`'your_app_id_from_gitlab'`|
|`gitlab_secret`|OAuth Application Secret from GitLab for GitLab SSO to Grafana. (Now deprecated/removed)|`'your_app_secret_from_gitlab'`|
|`allowed_groups`|Array of GitLab group paths allowed to sign in via GitLab SSO. (Now deprecated/removed)|`['my-company/developers']`|
|`home_url`|The root URL for Grafana, typically appended to `external_url`. (Now deprecated/removed)|`'/-/grafana'`|

```
While bundled Grafana is no longer part of current GitLab Omnibus releases, understanding its historical role and configuration is useful for administrators managing older instances or for those transitioning to external visualization solutions. GitLab continues to expose comprehensive metrics via Prometheus, ensuring that monitoring data remains available for consumption by any compatible platform.

## 4. Component Interconnections: A Holistic View

Understanding how these individual components connect and interact is crucial for comprehending the overall behavior, performance, and potential points of failure within a GitLab Omnibus installation.

### 4.1. Visualizing the Flow: From User Request to Response

Different user actions trigger distinct interaction flows through the GitLab Omnibus components.

- **HTTP Project Page Load:**
    
    1. **Client (Browser):** Initiates an HTTP(S) request for a project page.
    2. **DNS Resolution:** Resolves GitLab domain to an IP address.
    3. **Load Balancer (Optional):** If present, distributes the request to an available Nginx node.
    4. **Nginx:** Receives the request.
        - Terminates SSL if the request is HTTPS.8
        - Serves any static assets (CSS, JS, images) directly from disk if applicable.8
        - For dynamic content, proxies the request to GitLab-workhorse.8
    5. **GitLab-workhorse:** Receives the request from Nginx.
        - Performs preliminary checks or header manipulations.
        - Proxies the request to Puma (GitLab-rails), usually via a Unix socket.12
    6. **Puma (GitLab-rails):** Receives the request from Workhorse.
        - Authenticates and authorizes the user (may involve PostgreSQL for user data, Redis for session data).7
        - Fetches project data, issue lists, MR details, etc., from PostgreSQL.7
        - Checks Redis for cached data to speed up response generation.23
        - If repository content (e.g., file browser, commit list) is needed, makes gRPC calls to Gitaly (or Praefect).25
        - Renders the HTML page.
    7. **GitLab-workhorse:** Receives the HTML response from Puma.
        - May perform final modifications or handle specific response types (e.g., `send_file` for downloads, though less common for a simple page load).12
        - Sends the response back to Nginx.
    8. **Nginx:** Sends the final HTML response to the client.
- **`git push` over HTTPS:**
    
    1. **Client (Git):** Initiates an HTTPS `git push` request.
    2. **DNS/Load Balancer/Nginx (SSL):** Similar to HTTP page load, request reaches Nginx, SSL is terminated. Nginx proxies to Workhorse.8
    3. **GitLab-workhorse:** Receives the push request.
        - Sends an authorization request to Puma/Rails to check if the user has push permissions for the repository.12 This involves checking the user's credentials and project permissions.
    4. **Puma (GitLab-rails):**
        - Performs authentication (e.g., checks API token or session) and authorization (checks project membership and permissions against PostgreSQL).7
        - If authorized, responds to Workhorse indicating it can proceed. It may also initiate pre-receive hook logic.
    5. **GitLab-workhorse:** If authorized by Rails, Workhorse then directly streams the Git packfile data from the client to the appropriate Gitaly server (or Praefect) via gRPC.12 It does not pass the entire packfile through Puma/Rails.
    6. **Gitaly/Praefect:**
        - **Gitaly:** Receives the packfile, validates it, runs pre-receive hooks (which may involve callbacks to Rails via GitLab Shell's internal API for more complex checks), updates the repository on disk, and runs post-receive hooks (e.g., to trigger CI pipelines, update MRs â€“ these also involve Rails).25
        - **Praefect (if Gitaly Cluster):** Receives the push from Workhorse, routes it to the primary Gitaly node, and manages replication of the new data to secondary Gitaly nodes.25
    7. **Gitaly/Praefect:** Sends a success/failure response back to Workhorse.
    8. **GitLab-workhorse:** Forwards the response to Nginx.
    9. **Nginx:** Sends the response to the Git client.
- **`git clone` over SSH:**
    
    1. **Client (Git):** Initiates an SSH connection for `git clone` (e.g., `git clone git@gitlab.example.com:group/project.git`).
    2. **DNS/Load Balancer (less common for SSH, usually direct to an SSH endpoint):** Connection reaches the server's SSH daemon (`sshd`) on port 22 (default).
    3. **`sshd` & GitLab Shell:**
        - `sshd` uses the `authorized_keys` file (managed by GitLab Shell) to identify the user based on their SSH key.
        - The command executed is forced to be `gitlab-shell`.31
        - GitLab Shell receives the original Git command (e.g., `git-upload-pack '/group/project.git'`).
        - It makes an internal API call to GitLab-rails (Puma) to authorize the user and the action, and to get the Gitaly server address for the repository.31
    4. **Puma (GitLab-rails):** Authenticates the user (based on SSH key ID) and authorizes access to the repository (checking PostgreSQL).7 Responds to GitLab Shell with authorization status and Gitaly details.
    5. **GitLab Shell:** If authorized, establishes a gRPC connection to the specified Gitaly server (or Praefect).31
    6. **Gitaly/Praefect:**
        - **Gitaly:** Receives the `upload-pack` request, reads the repository data from disk, and generates the packfile.25
        - **Praefect (if Gitaly Cluster):** Routes the request to a healthy Gitaly node (primary or replica, depending on read distribution settings).25
    7. **Gitaly/Praefect:** Streams the packfile data back to GitLab Shell via gRPC.
    8. **GitLab Shell:** Streams the packfile data over the SSH connection to the Git client.31
    9. **Client (Git):** Receives the packfile and creates the local repository.
- **Background Job (e.g., CI Pipeline Triggered by Push):**
    
    1. **Trigger:** An event occurs (e.g., a successful `git push` processed as above, a scheduled task, a manual trigger via UI/API).
    2. **GitLab-rails (Puma):** The Rails application, in response to the trigger, determines that a background job needs to be run (e.g., create a new CI pipeline). It serializes the job details (worker class, arguments) and enqueues it into a specific queue in Redis.23
    3. **Redis:** Stores the job in the designated queue.23
    4. **Sidekiq Worker:** A Sidekiq process, listening to that specific queue (or all queues if `*`), polls Redis and picks up the job.27
    5. **Sidekiq Worker Execution:**
        - Loads the GitLab Rails application environment.
        - Executes the job's logic. This can involve:
            - Interacting with PostgreSQL (e.g., to read pipeline configuration, update job status).28
            - Making gRPC calls to Gitaly/Praefect (e.g., to fetch source code for a CI job, run repository checks).28
            - Interacting with Object Storage (e.g., to upload CI artifacts, download cache).
            - Calling external services (e.g., sending webhooks, deploying to a server).
    6. **Sidekiq Worker:** After job completion (success or failure), it may update status in PostgreSQL or Redis, and potentially enqueue further jobs.
    
    Mapping these flows demonstrates the intricate dependencies within GitLab. For instance, a user experiencing a slow `git push` over HTTPS might encounter issues at any stage: Nginx request handling, Workhorse processing, Rails authorization delays (due to slow database or Redis), Gitaly processing speed, or even network latency between these components. This detailed understanding is invaluable for targeted troubleshooting and performance optimization.
    

### 4.2. Monitoring Data Flow: Exporters to Prometheus

The monitoring system in GitLab Omnibus relies on Prometheus collecting metrics from various exporters.

1. **Exporters:** Each key GitLab component, or a closely associated service, runs an exporter or has a built-in metrics endpoint. This includes:
    - `node_exporter` for system-level metrics.
    - `postgres_exporter` for PostgreSQL database metrics.
    - `redis_exporter` for Redis metrics.
    - `gitlab-exporter` for application-level metrics from GitLab Rails and Sidekiq (often by querying the DB or Redis).
    - Built-in endpoints for Gitaly, GitLab-workhorse, Puma, Sidekiq, and Praefect, exposing their operational metrics.17
2. **Prometheus Scrape Configuration:** The central Prometheus server is configured with `scrape_configs`. These configurations tell Prometheus which endpoints to connect to (`targets`) and how often to pull (scrape) metrics.17 For bundled exporters, Omnibus GitLab typically pre-configures these scrape jobs.
3. **Metrics Collection (Pull Model):** Prometheus periodically makes HTTP requests to these exporter endpoints. The exporters respond with metrics in a text-based format that Prometheus parses.
4. **Time-Series Database (TSDB):** Prometheus stores these collected metrics along with timestamps in its local time-series database.17
5. **Alerting:** Alertmanager, often configured alongside Prometheus, evaluates alerting rules defined in Prometheus against the collected metrics. If an alert condition is met, Alertmanager handles deduplication, grouping, and routing of notifications.43

This decentralized approach, where components expose metrics and Prometheus pulls them, is a robust and scalable model. If one exporter becomes unavailable, Prometheus can continue to collect metrics from other sources. The health of the monitoring system itself (Prometheus, Alertmanager, exporters) is also typically monitored.

### 4.3. Data Persistence: PostgreSQL and Redis Usage

GitLab relies on two primary data stores for persistence: PostgreSQL for relational data and Redis for in-memory data and queues.

- **PostgreSQL Usage:**
    
    - **GitLab-rails:** This is the most significant user of PostgreSQL. It stores all core relational data, including 7:
        - User accounts, profiles, permissions, and group memberships.
        - Project details, settings, and metadata.
        - Issues, merge requests, comments, labels, milestones.
        - CI/CD pipeline configurations, job details, runner registrations, and build metadata.
        - Container registry metadata (image tags, layers - though blobs are in object storage).
        - Wiki content (historically, now often in Git itself).
        - Audit logs and system settings.
    - **Praefect:** If Gitaly Cluster is used, Praefect maintains its own PostgreSQL database to store metadata about the cluster, including 25:
        - Virtual storage configurations.
        - Mapping of repositories to Gitaly nodes (primary and secondaries).
        - Replication job queues and status.
        - Health check information for Gitaly nodes.
        - Transaction states for distributed Git operations.
- Redis Usage:
    
    Redis serves multiple purposes, leveraging its speed for tasks requiring low latency or frequent updates 23:
    
    - **GitLab-rails:**
        - **Caching:** Stores frequently accessed application data, rendered UI fragments, and results of expensive computations to reduce database load and improve response times.
        - **Session Storage:** Manages user web sessions, allowing users to remain authenticated.
        - **ActionCable Backend:** Facilitates real-time communication features (e.g., live updates in issue boards) via WebSockets.
        - **Rate Limiting:** Stores counters and timestamps for various rate-limiting mechanisms.
    - **Sidekiq:**
        - **Job Queues:** The primary message broker for Sidekiq. Rails enqueues background jobs here.
        - **Job Status & Metadata:** Stores information about scheduled jobs, retries, and processed jobs.
    - **GitLab-workhorse:**
        - **CI Long Polling:** Can use Redis Pub/Sub to efficiently notify CI runners of new jobs, reducing polling load on Rails.12
    - **CI Trace Chunks:** Temporarily stores chunks of CI job logs before they are archived.23

This division of labor is a standard and effective architecture for complex web applications. PostgreSQL provides durability and transactional integrity for core metadata, while Redis offers high-performance caching, queuing, and state management for more ephemeral or frequently changing data. Praefect's reliance on PostgreSQL for its metadata underscores the critical nature of this database for Gitaly HA functionality.

## 5. GitLab Omnibus Mind Map

A visual mind map accompanies this report as a supplementary asset. This mind map is designed to provide a non-linear, at-a-glance overview of the GitLab Omnibus components and their primary relationships.

The mind map will visually represent:

- **Central Nodes:** Each of the ten core components (Nginx, GitLab-workhorse, Puma, GitLab-rails, Redis, Sidekiq, Gitaly, Praefect, Prometheus, and Grafana - noting its deprecated status) will be depicted as a distinct node.
- **Key Responsibilities:** Succinctly listed under each component node will be its primary functions and responsibilities as detailed in Section 3 of this report.
- **Interconnections:** Arrows and connecting lines will illustrate the primary directions of data flow, request initiation, and dependencies between components. For example:
    - An arrow from Nginx to GitLab-workhorse, then to Puma.
    - Bidirectional arrows between Puma and PostgreSQL, and Puma and Redis.
    - An arrow from Puma (enqueuing jobs) to Redis, and from Redis (dequeuing jobs) to Sidekiq.
    - Arrows from Puma, Workhorse, and GitLab Shell to Gitaly (or Praefect if Gitaly Cluster is implied).
    - Arrows from various component exporters to Prometheus.
- **External Interactions:** Connections to key external entities such as "Client (Browser/Git)", "Object Storage", and "SMTP Server" will be shown to contextualize GitLab's place in a wider ecosystem.
- **Configuration & Management:** A general indicator pointing towards `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` for configuration and `gitlab-ctl` for management will be associated with the overall Omnibus system.

This mind map serves as a complementary tool to the detailed textual descriptions, aiding in the rapid comprehension of the system's architecture and the roles of its constituent parts. It facilitates a quicker grasp of how a change or issue in one component might ripple through the system.

## 6. Conclusion and Best Practices

The GitLab Omnibus package, while simplifying deployment, orchestrates a complex ecosystem of interdependent services. Each component, from the Nginx web server at the entry point to the Gitaly and Praefect services managing Git data, plays a specialized and critical role. Effective administration, scaling, and troubleshooting of a GitLab instance hinge on a solid understanding of these components and their intricate interactions.

### 6.1. Recap of Component Interdependencies

The analysis reveals a tightly coupled system where:

- **Request Flow:** HTTP/S requests traverse Nginx, GitLab-workhorse, and Puma/GitLab-rails, with SSH requests handled by GitLab Shell. Each step involves specific responsibilities and potential bottlenecks.
- **Data Stores:** PostgreSQL is the ultimate source of truth for metadata, while Redis is vital for caching, session management, and enabling asynchronous operations via Sidekiq. Praefect adds its own PostgreSQL dependency for Gitaly Cluster metadata.
- **Background Processing:** Sidekiq relies heavily on Redis for job queuing and interacts with Rails, PostgreSQL, and Gitaly to perform its tasks.
- **Git Operations:** Gitaly (and Praefect for HA) is central to all Git repository access, serving requests from Rails, Workhorse, and Shell.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus forms the backbone of metrics collection, pulling data from exporters across all major components.

A failure or misconfiguration in a foundational service like Redis or PostgreSQL can have cascading effects across the entire application. Similarly, performance issues in Gitaly can directly impact user experience for Git operations.

### 6.2. General Recommendations for Monitoring

Proactive monitoring is essential for maintaining a healthy GitLab instance.

- **Leverage Prometheus:** Utilize the rich set of metrics exposed by the bundled Prometheus server and its exporters. Pay attention to error rates, latencies, saturation (e.g., CPU, memory, disk I/O), and queue lengths for key components.
    - **Nginx:** Monitor request rates, error rates (4xx, 5xx), and response times.
    - **GitLab-workhorse:** Track request duration, in-flight requests, and error rates.
    - **Puma:** Monitor worker saturation, request queue depth, response times, and memory usage per worker.
    - **Redis:** Observe memory usage, connected clients, command latency, and cache hit/miss ratios.
    - **Sidekiq:** Keep a close eye on queue lengths for all queues (especially `default`, `mailers`, and any custom high-traffic queues), job failure rates, and processing latencies.
    - **PostgreSQL:** Monitor connection counts, query performance, replication lag (if applicable), disk space, and transaction rates.
    - **Gitaly/Praefect:** Track RPC latencies, error rates, feature flag status, replication status (for Praefect), and disk I/O on Gitaly nodes.
- **External Grafana:** Since bundled Grafana is removed, set up an external Grafana instance (or another visualization tool) to connect to your GitLab Prometheus data source. Utilize or adapt community dashboards or create custom ones tailored to your workload. The official GitLab runbooks repository often contains `grafonnet` dashboard definitions that can be adapted.56
- **Log Aggregation:** For larger or more complex setups, consider centralizing logs from all GitLab components into a log aggregation system (e.g., Elasticsearch/Kibana, Splunk, Grafana Loki). This greatly simplifies searching and correlating log events during troubleshooting. Default log locations are generally under `/var/log/gitlab/<component_name>/`.6
- **Alerting:** Configure Alertmanager (via `gitlab.rb`) with meaningful alerting rules based on the collected Prometheus metrics to be proactively notified of issues.

### 6.3. General Recommendations for Troubleshooting

A systematic approach is key when diagnosing issues.

- **Identify Scope:** Determine if the issue affects all users, specific projects, particular operations (e.g., only Git pushes, only CI jobs), or specific nodes in a multi-node setup.
- **Trace Request Flow:** Mentally (or with diagrams) trace the request path for the failing operation, considering all involved components as outlined in Section 4.1. This helps narrow down potential culprits.
- **Check Component Logs:** Examine the logs of the components suspected to be involved in the problematic flow. For example:
    - UI errors or slow page loads: Nginx, Workhorse, Puma, `production.log`, PostgreSQL, Redis.
    - Git operation failures: GitLab Shell (for SSH), Workhorse (for HTTP), Rails (auth), Gitaly/Praefect.
    - Background job failures: Sidekiq logs, and logs of services it interacts with (DB, Gitaly). Log locations are generally `/var/log/gitlab/<component_name>/`.6 Use `sudo gitlab-ctl tail <service>` for live log viewing.4
- **Service Status:** Use `sudo gitlab-ctl status` to quickly check if all Omnibus-managed services are running correctly.5
- **Configuration Changes:** If an issue arose after a configuration change, review `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`. Use `sudo gitlab-ctl diff-config` to see differences between the current `gitlab.rb` and the template for the running version. Remember to run `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` after any `gitlab.rb` modification.5
- **GitLab Health Checks:** Run `sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check` for a general health check of the GitLab application,

# Grafana and Prometheus Basics for GitLab Monitoring

Two popular open-source tools often integrated with GitLab for comprehensive monitoring and observability.

## What is Grafana?

Grafana is a powerful data visualization and exploration tool. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored. Key characteristics include:

* **Data Source Agnostic:** Supports numerous data sources like Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, and PostgreSQL.
* **Rich Visualizations:** Offers various panel types (graphs, gauges, tables, etc.) to display data effectively.
* **Dashboards:** Enables the creation of organized collections of panels for a holistic view of system performance.
* **Alerting:** Provides a system to define rules and send notifications based on metric thresholds.
* **Templating:** Allows for dynamic dashboards that can adapt based on variables.

## What is Prometheus?

Prometheus is a popular open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit built for reliability and scalability. It excels at collecting and storing time-series data (metrics) as streams of timestamped values. Key characteristics include:

* **Time-Series Database:** Stores data with timestamps and optional key-value pairs called labels.
* **Pull-Based Model:** Scrapes metrics from configured targets (e.g., GitLab instances, nodes, services) over HTTP.
* **PromQL:** A powerful query language for exploring and aggregating metrics.
* **Alertmanager:** A separate component for handling alerts triggered by Prometheus.
* **Service Discovery:** Supports various mechanisms for automatically discovering targets to monitor.

## Why Grafana and Prometheus for GitLab Monitoring?

GitLab often recommends or integrates well with Grafana and Prometheus for providing detailed insights into the performance and health of the GitLab instance itself, as well as the applications and infrastructure it manages.

* **GitLab Metrics:** Prometheus can be configured to scrape various metrics exposed by GitLab, such as resource usage (CPU, memory), request latency, background job performance, and more.
* **System Monitoring:** Prometheus can also monitor the underlying infrastructure where GitLab is running (servers, Kubernetes clusters, etc.).
* **Centralized Visualization:** Grafana can pull data from Prometheus (and other sources) to create unified dashboards showing the health and performance of the entire GitLab ecosystem.
* **Alerting on Issues:** Prometheus can trigger alerts based on defined rules (e.g., high CPU usage), and Grafana can be configured to display these alerts.

## Core Concepts

### Prometheus

#### 1. Metrics and Time Series

* **Metric:** A named stream of timestamped numerical data points.
* **Time Series:** A sequence of these data points belonging to the same metric and the same set of labels.

    **Example Metric:** `gitlab_rails_http_requests_total`

    **Example Time Series (with labels):**
    ```
    gitlab_rails_http_requests_total{controller="projects", action="show", method="GET", status="200"} 1234 1678886400
    gitlab_rails_http_requests_total{controller="users", action="show", method="GET", status="200"} 5678 1678886400
    ```

#### 2. Labels

* Key-value pairs that provide dimensional information about a metric.
* Allow you to filter, aggregate, and analyze metrics based on different attributes (e.g., instance, job, controller).
	-  **Dimensionality:** Labels allow you to differentiate between different characteristics of the same metric (e.g., distinguishing requests by method or endpoint). Without labels, you only have a single time series for the entire metric, losing valuable context.  
	- **Filtering and Aggregation:** PromQL heavily relies on labels for filtering specific data and aggregating metrics across different dimensions. Without labels, these powerful querying capabilities are severely limited.  
	- **Alerting:** Labels are crucial for defining targeted alerting rules based on specific conditions.

#### 3. Scraping

* Prometheus periodically polls configured targets (endpoints exposing metrics in a specific format) over HTTP to collect metrics.
* GitLab exposes a `/metrics` endpoint that Prometheus can scrape.

#### 4. PromQL (Prometheus Query Language)

* A powerful expression language used to query and aggregate Prometheus metrics.

    **Example PromQL Queries:**

    * **Rate of HTTP requests per second:**
      ```
      rate(gitlab_rails_http_requests_total[5m])
      ```
    * **Average CPU usage across all GitLab Sidekiq processes:**
      ```
      avg(rate(process_cpu_seconds_total{job="gitlab-sidekiq"}[1m]))
      ```
    * **Memory usage of the GitLab Unicorn process (in bytes):**
      ```
      process_resident_memory_bytes{job="gitlab-unicorn"}
      ```

#### 5. Alertmanager

* Handles alerts sent by Prometheus based on defined alerting rules.
* Can group, silence, and route alerts to various notification channels (e.g., email, Slack).

### Grafana

#### 1. Data Sources

* Connections to various data storage systems, including Prometheus.
* You configure data sources in Grafana to tell it where to fetch metrics from.

#### 2. Panels

* Individual visualizations within a dashboard that display data from a selected data source using a chosen panel type (e.g., Graph, Gauge, Table).
* Each panel has its own query and display settings.

#### 3. Dashboards

* Collections of one or more panels arranged in a grid layout.
* Provide a consolidated view of relevant metrics.
* Grafana offers features like templating and annotations to enhance dashboards.

#### 4. Queries

* Used within panels to specify which data to retrieve from the configured data source (e.g., PromQL queries for Prometheus data sources).

#### 5. Alerting (in Grafana)

* Grafana also has its own alerting system that can be configured on panels to send notifications based on metric conditions.
* Often used in conjunction with or as an alternative to Prometheus Alertmanager.

## Interacting with Grafana and Prometheus (Basics)

* **Prometheus UI:** Accessed via its web interface (usually on port `9090`). You can use it to:
    * Execute PromQL queries.
    * View the current state of targets.
    * See active alerts.

* **Grafana UI:** Accessed via its web interface (usually on port `3000`). You can use it to:
    * Configure data sources.
    * Create and manage dashboards.
    * Set up alerts.
    * Explore data using the Explore feature.

## Relevance to GitLab Administration

Integrating Grafana and Prometheus with GitLab provides valuable insights for:

* **Performance Monitoring:** Identifying slow endpoints, high resource consumption, and potential bottlenecks in GitLab.
* **System Health:** Tracking the overall health and stability of the GitLab instance and its dependencies.
* **Troubleshooting:** Diagnosing issues by examining relevant metrics and identifying patterns.
* **Capacity Planning:** Understanding resource utilization trends to plan for future growth.
* **User Experience:** Monitoring metrics related to user interactions and identifying areas for improvement.

## Integration with GitLab

GitLab often provides documentation and tools to facilitate the integration of Prometheus and Grafana:

* **GitLab Exporter:** GitLab exposes metrics in the Prometheus format through its `/metrics` endpoint.
* **Pre-built Dashboards:** GitLab might provide example Grafana dashboards that can be imported.
* **Monitoring Integrations:** GitLab can be configured to connect to existing Prometheus and Grafana instances.

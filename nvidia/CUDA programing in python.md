# CUDA Python with Numba: Study Guide

## Quiz

1. What is Numba and what is its primary purpose in the context of Python programming? Numba is a just-in-time Python function compiler. Its primary purpose is to accelerate numerically-focused Python functions, allowing them to be executed faster on either a CPU or an NVIDIA GPU.
2. Explain the significance of the "just-in-time" aspect of the Numba compiler. Being "just-in-time" means Numba compiles functions when they are first called. This allows the compiler to know the specific argument types being used, leading to specialized and potentially faster implementations.
3. What is "type-specializing" in the context of Numba, and why is it important for performance? Type-specializing means Numba generates optimized implementations for the specific data types a function is called with. Python's flexibility with generic types is slow, so specializing for the actual data types used results in significant speedups.
4. What is the difference between Numba's jit and njit decorators? Which is generally recommended for best performance? @jit is the basic decorator, which can fall back to object mode if type inference fails. @njit is an alias for @jit(nopython=True). njit forces "nopython mode", which is recommended as it leads to the best performance and flags potential compilation issues.
5. How does Numba typically compile functions for the CPU? Numba compiles functions for the CPU by applying a function decorator, such as @jit or @njit, to a Python function. This triggers the compilation process when the function is first called with specific argument types.
6. What are NumPy Universal Functions (ufuncs), and why are they a good fit for GPU acceleration with Numba? NumPy ufuncs are functions that operate element-by-element on NumPy arrays. They are naturally data parallel, meaning the same operation is performed on many different elements concurrently, which aligns well with how GPU hardware is designed for massive parallelism.
7. What decorator is used in Numba to create compiled ufuncs, especially for the GPU? What additional arguments are required for GPU compilation? The @vectorize decorator is used to create compiled ufuncs. For GPU compilation, an explicit type signature (specifying argument and return types) and setting the target='cuda' attribute are required.
8. When accelerating a simple calculation on small data using Numba's @vectorize for the GPU, why might the GPU version initially appear slower than the CPU version? The GPU might appear slower due to overhead associated with sending calculations to the GPU, copying small amounts of data to and from the device, and insufficient data parallelism for the task. GPUs excel at performing many operations concurrently on large datasets.
9. What are CUDA Device Arrays, and how do they help optimize data transfers between the CPU host and GPU device? CUDA Device Arrays are arrays allocated directly on the GPU memory. By using them, you can avoid the automatic copying of data back to the CPU host after each GPU operation, allowing for sequences of GPU operations without repeated data transfers.
10. What is a CUDA device function, and how is it indicated in Numba? A CUDA device function is a helper function that can only be called from another function running on the GPU (a kernel or another device function). It is indicated by decorating the function with @cuda.jit(device=True).

## Glossary of Key Terms

- **CUDA:** A parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA that enables developers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose processing.
- **Numba:** A just-in-time, type-specializing, function compiler for accelerating numerically-focused Python for either a CPU or GPU.

In parallel computing, GPUs are used for their ability to perform highly parallel computations.

- **Just-in-time (JIT) Compilation:** A method of executing computer code that involves compilation during execution of a program, rather than before execution.
- **Type-specializing:** The process by which a compiler generates a specific, optimized implementation of a function tailored to the data types of the arguments it is called with.
- **Function Compiler:** A compiler that processes individual functions within a program, rather than the entire program or parts of functions.
- **Numerically-focused:** Code or libraries designed primarily to work with numerical data types like integers, floats, and complex numbers, often involving mathematical or scientific computations.
- **NumPy:** A Python library used for working with arrays, offering support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- **NumPy Universal Function (ufunc):** A function that operates on ndarrays element-by-element.
- **Vectorize:** In Numba, a decorator (@vectorize) used to create compiled ufuncs, allowing a scalar function to be applied element-wise to NumPy arrays.
- **Decorator:** A function modifier in Python that transforms another function. In Numba, decorators like @jit, @njit, and @vectorize are used to trigger compilation.

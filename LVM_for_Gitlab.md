Okay, let's get those LVM volumes set up for your Omnibus GitLab installation. Regarding your question about logical volumes, it depends on the level of isolation and flexibility you desire.

* **Separate Logical Volumes:** Creating a dedicated logical volume for each directory (`var/opt/gitlab`, `var/log/gitlab`, `var/opt/gitlab/git-data`, `var/opt/gitlab/git-data1`, `var/opt/gitlab/artifacts`, `gitaly-backup`, `etc/gitlab`) offers more granular control over storage allocation, resizing, and potentially snapshots. If one volume fills up, it won't directly impact the others.

* **Fewer Logical Volumes:** Creating logical volumes for parent directories (e.g., one for `/var/opt/gitlab`, one for `/var/log/gitlab`, one for `gitaly-backup`, and one for `/etc/gitlab`) simplifies management but means that storage space is shared among the subdirectories. If one subdirectory consumes all the space in its parent's logical volume, it could affect the others.

For GitLab, which can have varying I/O and storage requirements for different components, **creating separate logical volumes for the primary data directories is generally recommended** for better performance and stability. This would include at least:

* One for `/var/opt/gitlab` (which will contain `git-data`, `git-data1`, and `artifacts`)
* One for `/var/log/gitlab`
* One for `gitaly-backup`
* One for `/etc/gitlab`

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide assuming you have already identified the physical volume(s) you want to use for your volume group (let's call it `gitlab_vg`). You'll likely need to SSH into your OpenShift VM to perform these commands.

**Step 1: SSH into your OpenShift VM**

Use your preferred method to establish an SSH connection to the virtual machine where you are installing GitLab.

**Step 2: Verify Physical Volumes (PVs) and Volume Group (VG)**

First, let's ensure your physical volumes are recognized and your volume group exists.

```bash
sudo pvs
sudo vgs
```

Identify the physical volume(s) you intend to use and confirm the volume group name (replace `gitlab_vg` with your actual volume group name if it's different).

**Step 3: Create Logical Volumes (LVs)**

Now, we'll create the logical volumes. Adjust the `-L` size as needed for your environment.

```bash
sudo lvcreate -n lv_opt_gitlab -L 50G gitlab_vg  # Example size, adjust as needed
sudo lvcreate -n lv_log_gitlab -L 10G gitlab_vg  # Example size, adjust as needed
sudo lvcreate -n lv_backup -L 20G gitlab_vg     # Example size, adjust as needed
sudo lvcreate -n lv_etc_gitlab -L 5G gitlab_vg   # Example size, adjust as needed
```

* `-n <lv_name>`: Specifies the name of the logical volume.
* `-L <size>`: Specifies the size of the logical volume (e.g., 50G for 50 Gigabytes).
* `<vg_name>`: The name of your volume group.

**Step 4: Create Filesystems on the Logical Volumes**

Next, we need to create filesystems on these logical volumes. We'll use ext4 as an example.

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/gitlab_vg/lv_opt_gitlab
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/gitlab_vg/lv_log_gitlab
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/gitlab_vg/lv_backup
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/gitlab_vg/lv_etc_gitlab
```

**Step 5: Create Mount Points**

Now, create the directories where you want to mount these logical volumes.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/opt/gitlab
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/gitlab
sudo mkdir -p /gitaly-backup
sudo mkdir -p /etc/gitlab
sudo mkdir -p /var/opt/gitlab/git-data
sudo mkdir -p /var/opt/gitlab/git-data1
sudo mkdir -p /var/opt/gitlab/artifacts
```

**Step 6: Configure `/etc/fstab` for Persistent Mounts**

To ensure these logical volumes are mounted automatically upon system boot, you need to add entries to the `/etc/fstab` file. You can use `vim` to edit this file.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/fstab
```

Add the following lines to the end of the file. Replace `/dev/gitlab_vg/` with the actual path to your logical volumes if necessary.

```
/dev/gitlab_vg/lv_opt_gitlab  /var/opt/gitlab ext4 defaults 0 0
/dev/gitlab_vg/lv_log_gitlab   /var/log/gitlab  ext4 defaults 0 0
/dev/gitlab_vg/lv_backup      /gitaly-backup  ext4 defaults 0 0
/dev/gitlab_vg/lv_etc_gitlab   /etc/gitlab     ext4 defaults 0 0
```

* The first field is the device to mount.
* The second field is the mount point.
* The third field is the filesystem type.
* The fourth field specifies mount options (defaults are usually fine).
* The fifth field is used by `dump` (set to 0).
* The sixth field is used by `fsck` to determine the order of filesystem checks during boot (set to 0 for the root filesystem and 1 for others, but for data volumes, 0 is often appropriate).

**Step 7: Mount the Filesystems**

Finally, mount the newly added filesystems.

```bash
sudo mount -a
```

This command will mount all filesystems listed in `/etc/fstab`. You can verify that the volumes are mounted correctly using the `df -h` command.

```bash
df -h
```

You should see your newly created logical volumes and their mount points listed.

Now you have the LVM volumes and directories set up for your Omnibus GitLab installation. When you proceed with the GitLab installation, it will use these mount points to store its data and configurations. Remember to adjust the logical volume sizes based on your expected GitLab usage.
